The Strange Story of Jonathan SmallChapter IThe Science of DeductionSherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece andhis hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long,white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled backhis left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfullyupon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred withinnumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home,pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-linedarm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, butcustom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day today I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swellednightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage toprotest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should delivermy soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalantair of my companion which made him the last man with whom one wouldcare to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, hismasterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his manyextraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossinghim.Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had takenwith my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extremedeliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out nolonger.“Which is it to-day?” I asked,—“morphine or cocaine?”He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which hehad opened. “It is cocaine,” he said,—“a seven-per-cent. solution.Would you care to try it?”“No, indeed,” I answered, brusquely. “My constitution has not got overthe Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain uponit.”He smiled at my vehemence. “Perhaps you are right, Watson,” he said. “Isuppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find it, however,so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that itssecondary action is a matter of small moment.”“But consider!” I said, earnestly. “Count the cost! Your brain may, asyou say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbidprocess, which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave apermanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes uponyou. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you, for amere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with whichyou have been endowed? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade toanother, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is tosome extent answerable.”He did not seem offended. On the contrary, he put his finger-tipstogether and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one whohas a relish for conversation.“My mind,” he said, “rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give mework, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricateanalysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense thenwith artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence.I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my ownparticular profession,—or rather created it, for I am the only one inthe world.”“The only unofficial detective?” I said, raising my eyebrows.“The only unofficial consulting detective,” he answered. “I am the lastand highest court of appeal in detection. When Gregson or Lestrade orAthelney Jones are out of their depths—which, by the way, is theirnormal state—the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as anexpert, and pronounce a specialist’s opinion. I claim no credit in suchcases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasureof finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. Butyou have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in theJefferson Hope case.”“Yes, indeed,” said I, cordially. “I was never so struck by anything inmy life. I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhatfantastic title of ‘A Study in Scarlet.’”He shook his head sadly. “I glanced over it,” said he. “Honestly, Icannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exactscience, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner.You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces muchthe same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into thefifth proposition of Euclid.”“But the romance was there,” I remonstrated. “I could not tamper withthe facts.”“Some facts should be suppressed, or at least a just sense ofproportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in thecase which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning fromeffects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it.”I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been speciallydesigned to please him. I confess, too, that I was irritated by theegotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should bedevoted to his own special doings. More than once during the years thatI had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanityunderlay my companion’s quiet and didactic manner. I made no remark,however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had a Jezail bullet throughit some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from walking, itached wearily at every change of the weather.“My practice has extended recently to the Continent,” said Holmes,after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe. “I was consultedlast week by François Le Villard, who, as you probably know, has comerather to the front lately in the French detective service. He has allthe Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the widerange of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developmentsof his art. The case was concerned with a will, and possessed somefeatures of interest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases,the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which havesuggested to him the true solution. Here is the letter which I had thismorning acknowledging my assistance.” He tossed over, as he spoke, acrumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I glanced my eyes down it,catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray “magnifiques,”“coup-de-maîtres,” and “tours-de-force,” all testifying to the ardentadmiration of the Frenchman.“He speaks as a pupil to his master,” said I.“Oh, he rates my assistance too highly,” said Sherlock Holmes, lightly.“He has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out of the threequalities necessary for the ideal detective. He has the power ofobservation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in knowledge; andthat may come in time. He is now translating my small works intoFrench.”“Your works?”“Oh, didn’t you know?” he cried, laughing. “Yes, I have been guilty ofseveral monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, forexample, is one ‘Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the VariousTobaccoes.’ In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-,cigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with coloured plates illustrating thedifference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up incriminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as aclue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has beendone by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrowsyour field of search. To the trained eye there is as much differencebetween the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff ofbird’s-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.”“You have an extraordinary genius for minutiæ,” I remarked.“I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracingof footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as apreserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon theinfluence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of thehands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, anddiamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interest to thescientific detective,—especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or indiscovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with myhobby.”“Not at all,” I answered, earnestly. “It is of the greatest interest tome, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing yourpractical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation anddeduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other.”“Why, hardly,” he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair,and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. “For example,observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore StreetPost-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when thereyou dispatched a telegram.”“Right!” said I. “Right on both points! But I confess that I don’t seehow you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I havementioned it to no one.”“It is simplicity itself,” he remarked, chuckling at my surprise,—“soabsurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it mayserve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observationtells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep.Just opposite the Wigmore Street Office they have taken up the pavementand thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficultto avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiarreddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in theneighbourhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction.”“How, then, did you deduce the telegram?”“Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I satopposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there thatyou have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards. What couldyou go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire? Eliminateall other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.”“In this case it certainly is so,” I replied, after a little thought.“The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you thinkme impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?”“On the contrary,” he answered, “it would prevent me from taking asecond dose of cocaine. I should be delighted to look into any problemwhich you might submit to me.”“I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any objectin daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon itin such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here awatch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have thekindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of thelate owner?”I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in myheart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and Iintended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which heoccasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard atthe dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his nakedeyes and then with a powerful convex lens. I could hardly keep fromsmiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to andhanded it back.“There are hardly any data,” he remarked. “The watch has been recentlycleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.”“You are right,” I answered. “It was cleaned before being sent to me.”In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame andimpotent excuse to cover his failure. What data could he expect from anuncleaned watch?“Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,” heobserved, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes.“Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged toyour elder brother, who inherited it from your father.”“That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?”“Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch isnearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: soit was made for the last generation. Jewelry usually descends to theeldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father.Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has,therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.”“Right, so far,” said I. “Anything else?”“He was a man of untidy habits,—very untidy and careless. He was leftwith good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some timein poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally,taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather.”I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room withconsiderable bitterness in my heart.“This is unworthy of you, Holmes,” I said. “I could not have believedthat you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into thehistory of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce thisknowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe thatyou have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and, to speakplainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.”“My dear doctor,” said he, kindly, “pray accept my apologies. Viewingthe matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal andpainful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I nevereven knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.”“Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts?They are absolutely correct in every particular.”“Ah, that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance ofprobability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate.”“But it was not mere guess-work?”“No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit,—destructive to thelogical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you donot follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon whichlarge inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that yourbrother was careless. When you observe the lower part of thatwatch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but itis cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hardobjects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is nogreat feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch socavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetchedinference that a man who inherits one article of such value is prettywell provided for in other respects.”I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.“It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take awatch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon theinside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no riskof the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than foursuch numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case.Inference,—that your brother was often at low water. Secondaryinference,—that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could nothave redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the innerplate, which contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of scratchesall round the hole,—marks where the key has slipped. What sober man’skey could have scored those grooves? But you will never see adrunkard’s watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leavesthese traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?”“It is as clear as daylight,” I answered. “I regret the injustice whichI did you. I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty. MayI ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present?”“None. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live without brain-work. What elseis there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary,dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down thestreet and drifts across the dun-coloured houses. What could be morehopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of having powers,doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime iscommonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save thosewhich are commonplace have any function upon earth.”I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crisp knockour landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.“A young lady for you, sir,” she said, addressing my companion.“Miss Mary Morstan,” he read. “Hum! I have no recollection of the name.Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson. Don’t go, doctor. I shouldprefer that you remain.”Chapter IIThe Statement of the CaseMiss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composureof manner. She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, anddressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, a plainness andsimplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limitedmeans. The dress was a sombre greyish beige, untrimmed and unbraided,and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by asuspicion of white feather in the side. Her face had neither regularityof feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet andamiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual andsympathetic. In an experience of women which extends over many nationsand three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face whichgave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could notbut observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed forher, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign ofintense inward agitation.“I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,” she said, “because you once enabledmy employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domesticcomplication. She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.”“Mrs. Cecil Forrester,” he repeated thoughtfully. “I believe that I wasof some slight service to her. The case, however, as I remember it, wasa very simple one.”“She did not think so. But at least you cannot say the same of mine. Ican hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable,than the situation in which I find myself.”Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened. He leaned forward inhis chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon hisclear-cut, hawklike features. “State your case,” said he, in brisk,business tones.I felt that my position was an embarrassing one. “You will, I am sure,excuse me,” I said, rising from my chair.To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me.“If your friend,” she said, “would be good enough to stop, he might beof inestimable service to me.”I relapsed into my chair.“Briefly,” she continued, “the facts are these. My father was anofficer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite achild. My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England. I wasplaced, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh,and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age. In the year1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelvemonths’ leave and came home. He telegraphed to me from London that hehad arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving theLangham Hotel as his address. His message, as I remember, was full ofkindness and love. On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and wasinformed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had goneout the night before and had not yet returned. I waited all day withoutnews of him. That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, Icommunicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all thepapers. Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this noword has ever been heard of my unfortunate father. He came home withhis heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead—”She put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short thesentence.“The date?” asked Holmes, opening his note-book.“He disappeared upon the 3rd of December, 1878,—nearly ten years ago.”“His luggage?”“Remained at the hotel. There was nothing in it to suggest a clue,—someclothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from theAndaman Islands. He had been one of the officers in charge of theconvict-guard there.”“Had he any friends in town?”“Only one that we know of,—Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the 34thBombay Infantry. The major had retired some little time before, andlived at Upper Norwood. We communicated with him, of course, but he didnot even know that his brother officer was in England.”“A singular case,” remarked Holmes.“I have not yet described to you the most singular part. About sixyears ago—to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882—an advertisementappeared in the _Times_ asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan andstating that it would be to her advantage to come forward. There was noname or address appended. I had at that time just entered the family ofMrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess. By her advice Ipublished my address in the advertisement column. The same day therearrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to me, whichI found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl. No word of writingwas enclosed. Since then every year upon the same date there has alwaysappeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl, without any clue asto the sender. They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rarevariety and of considerable value. You can see for yourselves that theyare very handsome.” She opened a flat box as she spoke, and showed mesix of the finest pearls that I had ever seen.“Your statement is most interesting,” said Sherlock Holmes. “Hasanything else occurred to you?”“Yes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you. Thismorning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read foryourself.”“Thank you,” said Holmes. “The envelope too, please. Postmark, London,S.W. Date, July 7. Hum! Man’s thumb-mark on corner,—probably postman.Best quality paper. Envelopes at sixpence a packet. Particular man inhis stationery. No address. ‘Be at the third pillar from the leftoutside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o’clock. If you aredistrustful, bring two friends. You are a wronged woman, and shall havejustice. Do not bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Yourunknown friend.’ Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery.What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?”“That is exactly what I want to ask you.”“Then we shall most certainly go. You and I and—yes, why, Dr. Watson isthe very man. Your correspondent says two friends. He and I have workedtogether before.”“But would he come?” she asked, with something appealing in her voiceand expression.“I should be proud and happy,” said I, fervently, “if I can be of anyservice.”“You are both very kind,” she answered. “I have led a retired life, andhave no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do,I suppose?”“You must not be later,” said Holmes. “There is one other point,however. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-boxaddresses?”“I have them here,” she answered, producing half a dozen pieces ofpaper.“You are certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Letus see, now.” He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave littledarting glances from one to the other. “They are disguised hands,except the letter,” he said, presently, “but there can be no questionas to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek _e_ will breakout, and see the twirl of the final _s_. They are undoubtedly by thesame person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan,but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of yourfather?”“Nothing could be more unlike.”“I expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, atsix. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matterbefore then. It is only half-past three. _Au revoir_, then.”“_Au revoir_,” said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance fromone to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom andhurried away. Standing at the window, I watched her walking brisklydown the street, until the grey turban and white feather were but aspeck in the sombre crowd.“What a very attractive woman!” I exclaimed, turning to my companion.He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids.“Is she?” he said, languidly. “I did not observe.”“You really are an automaton,—a calculating-machine!” I cried. “Thereis something positively inhuman in you at times.”He smiled gently. “It is of the first importance,” he said, “not toallow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is tome a mere unit,—a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities areantagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winningwoman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children fortheir insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance isa philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon theLondon poor.”“In this case, however—”“I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have youever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you makeof this fellow’s scribble?”“It is legible and regular,” I answered. “A man of business habits andsome force of character.”Holmes shook his head. “Look at his long letters,” he said. “Theyhardly rise above the common herd. That _d_ might be an _a_, and that_l_ an _e_. Men of character always differentiate their long letters,however illegibly they may write. There is vacillation in his _k_’s andself-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some fewreferences to make. Let me recommend this book,—one of the mostremarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade’s ‘Martyrdom of Man.’ Ishall be back in an hour.”I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts werefar from the daring speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon ourlate visitor,—her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strangemystery which overhung her life. If she were seventeen at the time ofher father’s disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,—a sweetage, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a littlesobered by experience. So I sat and mused, until such dangerousthoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plungedfuriously into the latest treatise upon pathology. What was I, an armysurgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I shoulddare to think of such things? She was a unit, a factor,—nothing more.If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a manthan to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o’-the-wisps of theimagination.Chapter IIIIn Quest of a SolutionIt was half-past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, andin excellent spirits,—a mood which in his case alternated with fits ofthe blackest depression.“There is no great mystery in this matter,” he said, taking the cup oftea which I had poured out for him. “The facts appear to admit of onlyone explanation.”“What! you have solved it already?”“Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestivefact, that is all. It is, however, _very_ suggestive. The details arestill to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files ofthe _Times_, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34thBombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.”“I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.”“No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstandisappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited isMajor Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London.Four years later Sholto dies. _Within a week of his death_ CaptainMorstan’s daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated fromyear to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as awronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation ofher father? And why should the presents begin immediately afterSholto’s death, unless it is that Sholto’s heir knows something of themystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternativetheory which will meet the facts?”“But what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too,should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, theletter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It istoo much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no otherinjustice in her case that you know of.”“There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,” saidSherlock Holmes, pensively. “But our expedition of to-night will solvethem all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Areyou all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past thehour.”I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmestook his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. Itwas clear that he thought that our night’s work might be a serious one.Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face wascomposed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did notfeel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we wereembarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answeredthe few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.“Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa’s,” she said. “Hisletters were full of allusions to the major. He and papa were incommand of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown agreat deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa’sdesk which no one could understand. I don’t suppose that it is of theslightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so Ibrought it with me. It is here.”Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee.He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.“It is paper of native Indian manufacture,” he remarked. “It has atsome time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be aplan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, andpassages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above itis ‘3.37 from left,’ in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corneris a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their armstouching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters,‘The sign of the four,—Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan,Dost Akbar.’ No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon thematter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance. It has been keptcarefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.”“It was in his pocket-book that we found it.”“Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be ofuse to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be muchdeeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider myideas.” He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn browand his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and Ichatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possibleoutcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve untilthe end of our journey.It was a September evening, and not yet seven o’clock, but the day hadbeen a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city.Mud-coloured clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down theStrand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threwa feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glarefrom the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, andthrew a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. Therewas, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endlessprocession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars oflight,—sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, theyflitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom oncemore. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening,with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to makeme nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan’s manner thatshe was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could risesuperior to petty influences. He held his open note-book upon his knee,and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the lightof his pocket-lantern.At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at theside-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms andfour-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes ofshirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardlyreached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small,dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.“Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?” he asked.“I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,” said she.He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us.“You will excuse me, miss,” he said with a certain dogged manner, “butI was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companionsis a police-officer.”“I give you my word on that,” she answered.He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across afour-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mountedto the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done sobefore the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at afurious pace through the foggy streets.The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place,on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a completehoax,—which was an inconceivable hypothesis,—or else we had good reasonto think that important issues might hang upon our journey. MissMorstan’s demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavoredto cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures inAfghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at oursituation and so curious as to our destination that my stories wereslightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one movinganecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night,and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had someidea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what withour pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost mybearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very longway. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered thenames as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuousby-streets.“Rochester Row,” said he. “Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on theVauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently.Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpses ofthe river.”We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with thelamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, andwas soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side.“Wordsworth Road,” said my companion. “Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane.Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest does notappear to take us to very fashionable regions.”We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighbourhood.Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glareand tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner. Then came rows oftwo-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and thenagain interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,—the monstertentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. Atlast the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of theother houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as darkas its neighbours, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. Onour knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindooservant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and ayellow sash. There was something strangely incongruous in this Orientalfigure framed in the commonplace doorway of a third-rate suburbandwelling-house.“The Sahib awaits you,” said he, and even as he spoke there came a highpiping voice from some inner room. “Show them in to me, khitmutgar,” itcried. “Show them straight in to me.”Chapter IVThe Story of the Bald-Headed ManWe followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill-lit andworse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threwopen. A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centreof the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristleof red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp whichshot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He writhedhis hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetualjerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose.Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellowand irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantlypassing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of hisobtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth. In point of facthe had just turned his thirtieth year.“Your servant, Miss Morstan,” he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice.“Your servant, gentlemen. Pray step into my little sanctum. A smallplace, miss, but furnished to my own liking. An oasis of art in thehowling desert of South London.”We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which heinvited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamondof the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest ofcurtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there toexpose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was ofamber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantlyinto it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart itincreased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah whichstood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dovewas hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of theroom. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odour.“Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,” said the little man, still jerking and smiling.“That is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And thesegentlemen—”“This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.”“A doctor, eh?” cried he, much excited. “Have you your stethoscope?Might I ask you—would you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as tomy mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may relyupon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.”I listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anythingamiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shiveredfrom head to foot. “It appears to be normal,” I said. “You have nocause for uneasiness.”“You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,” he remarked, airily. “I ama great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. I amdelighted to hear that they are unwarranted. Had your father, MissMorstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might havebeen alive now.”I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at thiscallous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstansat down, and her face grew white to the lips. “I knew in my heart thathe was dead,” said she.“I can give you every information,” said he, “and, what is more, I cando you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say.I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you,but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. The three of uscan show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let us have nooutsiders,—no police or officials. We can settle everythingsatisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing wouldannoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.” He sat down upon alow settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blueeyes.“For my part,” said Holmes, “whatever you may choose to say will go nofurther.”I nodded to show my agreement.“That is well! That is well!” said he. “May I offer you a glass ofChianti, Miss Morstan? Or of Tokay? I keep no other wines. Shall I opena flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection totobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odour of the Eastern tobacco. I ama little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.” Heapplied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrilythrough the rose-water. We sat all three in a semi-circle, with ourheads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerkylittle fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in thecentre.“When I first determined to make this communication to you,” said he,“I might have given you my address, but I feared that you mightdisregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took theliberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my manWilliams might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence inhis discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceedno further in the matter. You will excuse these precautions, but I am aman of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, andthere is nothing more unæsthetic than a policeman. I have a naturalshrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contactwith the rough crowd. I live, as you see, with some little atmosphereof elegance around me. I may call myself a patron of the arts. It is myweakness. The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a connoisseurmight perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there cannot bethe least question about the Bouguereau. I am partial to the modernFrench school.”“You will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,” said Miss Morstan, “but I am here atyour request to learn something which you desire to tell me. It is verylate, and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible.”“At the best it must take some time,” he answered; “for we shallcertainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew. We shallall go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew. He isvery angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me.I had quite high words with him last night. You cannot imagine what aterrible fellow he is when he is angry.”“If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start atonce,” I ventured to remark.He laughed until his ears were quite red. “That would hardly do,” hecried. “I don’t know what he would say if I brought you in that suddenway. No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to eachother. In the first place, I must tell you that there are severalpoints in the story of which I am myself ignorant. I can only lay thefacts before you as far as I know them myself.“My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of theIndian army. He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live atPondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood. He had prospered in India, andbrought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collectionof valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. With theseadvantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. Mytwin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children.“I very well remember the sensation which was caused by thedisappearance of Captain Morstan. We read the details in the papers,and, knowing that he had been a friend of our father’s, we discussedthe case freely in his presence. He used to join in our speculations asto what could have happened. Never for an instant did we suspect thathe had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,—that of all men healone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan.“We did know, however, that some mystery—some positive danger—overhungour father. He was very fearful of going out alone, and he alwaysemployed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge.Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them. He was oncelight-weight champion of England. Our father would never tell us whatit was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men with woodenlegs. On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-leggedman, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders. Wehad to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I used tothink this a mere whim of my father’s, but events have since led us tochange our opinion.“Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a greatshock to him. He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he openedit, and from that day he sickened to his death. What was in the letterwe could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it wasshort and written in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for years froman enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards theend of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that hewished to make a last communication to us.“When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathingheavily. He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either sideof the bed. Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement tous, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain. I shalltry and give it to you in his own very words.“‘I have only one thing,’ he said, ‘which weighs upon my mind at thissupreme moment. It is my treatment of poor Morstan’s orphan. The cursedgreed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld fromher the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. And yetI have made no use of it myself,—so blind and foolish a thing isavarice. The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that Icould not bear to share it with another. See that chaplet dipped withpearls beside the quinine-bottle. Even that I could not bear to partwith, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her.You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure. But sendher nothing—not even the chaplet—until I am gone. After all, men havebeen as bad as this and have recovered.“‘I will tell you how Morstan died,’ he continued. ‘He had suffered foryears from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one. I aloneknew it. When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain ofcircumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. Ibrought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan’s arrival hecame straight over here to claim his share. He walked over from thestation, and was admitted by my faithful old Lal Chowdar, who is nowdead. Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division ofthe treasure, and we came to heated words. Morstan had sprung out ofhis chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand tohis side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cuttinghis head against the corner of the treasure-chest. When I stooped overhim I found, to my horror, that he was dead.“‘For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do. Myfirst impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could notbut recognise that there was every chance that I would be accused ofhis murder. His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in hishead, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could notbe made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I wasparticularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul uponearth knew where he had gone. There seemed to be no necessity why anysoul ever should know.“‘I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw myservant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway. He stole in and bolted the doorbehind him. “Do not fear, Sahib,” he said. “No one need know that youhave killed him. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?” “I didnot kill him,” said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. “I heardit all, Sahib,” said he. “I heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow.But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us put himaway together.” That was enough to decide me. If my own servant couldnot believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good beforetwelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box? Lal Chowdar and I disposed ofthe body that night, and within a few days the London papers were fullof the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan. You will see fromwhat I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. My fault lies inthe fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure,and that I have clung to Morstan’s share as well as to my own. I wishyou, therefore, to make restitution. Put your ears down to my mouth.The treasure is hidden in—’“At this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyesstared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I cannever forget, ‘Keep him out! For Christ’s sake keep him out!’ We bothstared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. Aface was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see thewhitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. It was abearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression ofconcentrated malevolence. My brother and I rushed towards the window,but the man was gone. When we returned to my father his head haddropped and his pulse had ceased to beat.“We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder,save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in theflower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that ourimaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. We soon, however,had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agenciesat work all round us. The window of my father’s room was found open inthe morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon hischest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words ‘The sign of thefour’ scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secretvisitor may have been, we never knew. As far as we can judge, none ofmy father’s property had been actually stolen, though everything hadbeen turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiarincident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but itis still a complete mystery to us.”The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfullyfor a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to hisextraordinary narrative. At the short account of her father’s deathMiss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared thatshe was about to faint. She rallied however, on drinking a glass ofwater which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe uponthe side-table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with anabstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes.As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he hadcomplained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here at least was aproblem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost. Mr. Thaddeus Sholtolooked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effectwhich his story had produced, and then continued between the puffs ofhis overgrown pipe.“My brother and I,” said he, “were, as you may imagine, much excited asto the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and for monthswe dug and delved in every part of the garden, without discovering itswhereabouts. It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on hisvery lips at the moment that he died. We could judge the splendour ofthe missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. Over thischaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. Thepearls were evidently of great value, and he was averse to part withthem, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined tomy father’s fault. He thought, too, that if we parted with the chapletit might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble. It wasall that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan’saddress and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that atleast she might never feel destitute.”“It was a kindly thought,” said our companion, earnestly. “It wasextremely good of you.”The little man waved his hand deprecatingly. “We were your trustees,”he said. “That was the view which I took of it, though BrotherBartholomew could not altogether see it in that light. We had plenty ofmoney ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it would have been suchbad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. ‘Lemauvais goût mène au crime.’ The French have a very neat way of puttingthese things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so farthat I thought it best to set up rooms for myself: so I leftPondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me.Yesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance hasoccurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicatedwith Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwoodand demand our share. I explained my views last night to BrotherBartholomew: so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.”Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee.We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new developmentwhich the mysterious business had taken. Holmes was the first to springto his feet.“You have done well, sir, from first to last,” said he. “It is possiblethat we may be able to make you some small return by throwing somelight upon that which is still dark to you. But, as Miss Morstanremarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter throughwithout delay.”Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of hishookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befroggedtopcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned tightly up,in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attireby putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered theears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peakyface. “My health is somewhat fragile,” he remarked, as he led the waydown the passage. “I am compelled to be a valetudinarian.”Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidentlyprearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace.Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high abovethe rattle of the wheels.“Bartholomew is a clever fellow,” said he. “How do you think he foundout where the treasure was? He had come to the conclusion that it wassomewhere indoors: so he worked out all the cubic space of the house,and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should beunaccounted for. Among other things, he found that the height of thebuilding was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights ofall the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the spacebetween, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the totalto more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. Thesecould only be at the top of the building. He knocked a hole, therefore,in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sureenough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had beensealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stood thetreasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He lowered it through thehole, and there it lies. He computes the value of the jewels at notless than half a million sterling.”At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one anotheropen-eyed. Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change froma needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was theplace of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed tosay that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned asheavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words ofcongratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf tothe babble of our new acquaintance. He was clearly a confirmedhypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forthinterminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to thecomposition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which hebore about in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that he may notremember any of the answers which I gave him that night. Holmesdeclares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger oftaking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommendedstrychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I wascertainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachmansprang down to open the door.“This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,” said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,as he handed her out.Chapter VThe Tragedy of Pondicherry LodgeIt was nearly eleven o’clock when we reached this final stage of ournight’s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behindus, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward,and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peepingoccasionally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see for somedistance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from thecarriage to give us a better light upon our way.Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with avery high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrowiron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guideknocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.“Who is there?” cried a gruff voice from within.“It is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock by this time.”There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. Thedoor swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in theopening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon hisprotruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes.“That you, Mr. Thaddeus? But who are the others? I had no orders aboutthem from the master.”“No, McMurdo? You surprise me! I told my brother last night that Ishould bring some friends.”“He ain’t been out o’ his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have noorders. You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can letyou in, but your friends must just stop where they are.”This was an unexpected obstacle. Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in aperplexed and helpless manner. “This is too bad of you, McMurdo!” hesaid. “If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the younglady, too. She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.”“Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,” said the porter, inexorably. “Folk may befriends o’ yours, and yet no friends o’ the master’s. He pays me wellto do my duty, and my duty I’ll do. I don’t know none o’ your friends.”“Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,” cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. “I don’tthink you can have forgotten me. Don’t you remember the amateur whofought three rounds with you at Alison’s rooms on the night of yourbenefit four years back?”“Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” roared the prize-fighter. “God’s truth! howcould I have mistook you? If instead o’ standin’ there so quiet you hadjust stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw, I’dha’ known you without a question. Ah, you’re one that has wasted yourgifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you had joined thefancy.”“You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of thescientific professions open to me,” said Holmes, laughing. “Our friendwon’t keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.”“In you come, sir, in you come,—you and your friends,” he answered.“Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to becertain of your friends before I let them in.”Inside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump ofa house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where amoonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window. The vastsize of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck achill to the heart. Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and thelantern quivered and rattled in his hand.“I cannot understand it,” he said. “There must be some mistake. Idistinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is nolight in his window. I do not know what to make of it.”“Does he always guard the premises in this way?” asked Holmes.“Yes; he has followed my father’s custom. He was the favourite son, youknow, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more thanhe ever told me. That is Bartholomew’s window up there where themoonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light fromwithin, I think.”“None,” said Holmes. “But I see the glint of a light in that littlewindow beside the door.”“Ah, that is the housekeeper’s room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstonesits. She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mindwaiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and shehas no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?”He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of lightflickered and wavered all round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, andwe all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears. From the greatblack house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and mostpitiful of sounds,—the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman.“It is Mrs. Bernstone,” said Sholto. “She is the only woman in thehouse. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment.” He hurried for thedoor, and knocked in his peculiar way. We could see a tall old womanadmit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him.“Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! I am so glad youhave come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!” We heard her reiterated rejoicings untilthe door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone.Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes swung it slowly round, andpeered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps whichcumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her handwas in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two whohad never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or evenlook of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of troubleour hands instinctively sought for each other. I have marvelled at itsince, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I shouldgo out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her alsothe instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. So we stood handin hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for allthe dark things that surrounded us.“What a strange place!” she said, looking round.“It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it.I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat,where the prospectors had been at work.”“And from the same cause,” said Holmes. “These are the traces of thetreasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years lookingfor it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.”At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholtocame running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes.“There is something amiss with Bartholomew!” he cried. “I amfrightened! My nerves cannot stand it.” He was, indeed, half blubberingwith fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the greatAstrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrifiedchild.“Come into the house,” said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.“Yes, do!” pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. “I really do not feel equal togiving directions.”We all followed him into the housekeeper’s room, which stood upon theleft-hand side of the passage. The old woman was pacing up and downwith a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of MissMorstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.“God bless your sweet calm face!” she cried, with an hysterical sob.“It does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried thisday!”Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some fewwords of kindly womanly comfort which brought the colour back into theother’s bloodless cheeks.“Master has locked himself in and will not answer me,” she explained.“All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to bealone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went upand peeped through the key-hole. You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,—you mustgo up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joyand in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such a faceon him as that.”Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto’steeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to passmy hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees weretrembling under him. Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens outof his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to bemere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which servedas a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding thelamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss Morstan hadremained behind with the frightened housekeeper.The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length,with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and threedoors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same slow andmethodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long blackshadows streaming backwards down the corridor. The third door was thatwhich we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, andthen tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on theinside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see whenwe set our lamp up against it. The key being turned, however, the holewas not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantlyrose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.“There is something devilish in this, Watson,” said he, more moved thanI had ever before seen him. “What do you make of it?”I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaminginto the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance.Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for allbeneath was in shadow, there hung a face,—the very face of ourcompanion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the samecircular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance. Thefeatures were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnaturalgrin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to thenerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to that ofour little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he wasindeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to usthat his brother and he were twins.“This is terrible!” I said to Holmes. “What is to be done?”“The door must come down,” he answered, and, springing against it, heput all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did notyield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time itgave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within BartholomewSholto’s chamber.It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A doubleline of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite thedoor, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes,and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets.One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream ofdark-coloured liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavywith a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odour. A set of steps stood at oneside of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, andabove them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a manto pass through. At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope wasthrown carelessly together.By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seatedall in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and thatghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold, andhad clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only hisfeatures but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the mostfantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiarinstrument,—a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like ahammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn sheetof note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it,and then handed it to me.“You see,” he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, “The signof the four.”“In God’s name, what does it all mean?” I asked.“It means murder,” said he, stooping over the dead man. “Ah, I expectedit. Look here!” He pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn stuckin the skin just above the ear.“It looks like a thorn,” said I.“It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it ispoisoned.”I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin soreadily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of bloodshowed where the puncture had been.“This is all an insoluble mystery to me,” said I. “It grows darkerinstead of clearer.”“On the contrary,” he answered, “it clears every instant. I onlyrequire a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.”We had almost forgotten our companion’s presence since we entered thechamber. He was still standing in the doorway, the very picture ofterror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however,he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.“The treasure is gone!” he said. “They have robbed him of the treasure!There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him to do it! Iwas the last person who saw him! I left him here last night, and Iheard him lock the door as I came downstairs.”“What time was that?”“It was ten o’clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be calledin, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I amsure I shall. But you don’t think so, gentlemen? Surely you don’t thinkthat it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if itwere I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!” He jerked hisarms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy.“You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,” said Holmes, kindly, puttinghis hand upon his shoulder. “Take my advice, and drive down to thestation to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist them inevery way. We shall wait here until your return.”The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard himstumbling down the stairs in the dark.Chapter VISherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands, “we have half an hour toourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you,almost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence.Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlyingit.”“Simple!” I ejaculated.“Surely,” said he, with something of the air of a clinical professorexpounding to his class. “Just sit in the corner there, that yourfootprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first place,how did these folk come, and how did they go? The door has not beenopened since last night. How of the window?” He carried the lamp acrossto it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but addressing themto himself rather than to me. “Window is snibbed on the inner side.Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. Nowater-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by thewindow. It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot inmould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here againupon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson! This isreally a very pretty demonstration.”I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. “This is not afootmark,” said I.“It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of awooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy bootwith the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of thetimber-toe.”“It is the wooden-legged man.”“Quite so. But there has been some one else,—a very able and efficientally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?”I looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on thatangle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and,look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevicein the brick-work.“It is absolutely impossible,” I answered.“Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who loweredyou this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end ofit to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you were an activeman, You might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, ofcourse, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope,untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and getaway in the way that he originally came. As a minor point it may benoted,” he continued, fingering the rope, “that our wooden-leggedfriend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His handswere far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark,especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that heslipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand.”“This is all very well,” said I, “but the thing becomes moreunintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came heinto the room?”“Yes, the ally!” repeated Holmes, pensively. “There are features ofinterest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of thecommonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annalsof crime in this country,—though parallel cases suggest themselves fromIndia, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.”“How came he, then?” I reiterated. “The door is locked, the window isinaccessible. Was it through the chimney?”“The grate is much too small,” he answered. “I had already consideredthat possibility.”“How then?” I persisted.“You will not apply my precept,” he said, shaking his head. “How oftenhave I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossiblewhatever remains, _however improbable_, must be the truth? We know thathe did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We alsoknow that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is noconcealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?”“He came through the hole in the roof,” I cried.“Of course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the kindnessto hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the roomabove,—the secret room in which the treasure was found.”He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swunghimself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached downfor the lamp and held it while I followed him.The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way andsix the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thinlath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beamto beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shellof the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any sort, andthe accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.“Here you are, you see,” said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand againstthe sloping wall. “This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof.I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentleangle. This, then, is the way by which Number One entered. Let us seeif we can find any other traces of his individuality.”He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for thesecond time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face.For myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes.The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,—clear,well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of anordinary man.“Holmes,” I said, in a whisper, “a child has done the horrid thing.”He had recovered his self-possession in an instant. “I was staggeredfor the moment,” he said, “but the thing is quite natural. My memoryfailed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is nothingmore to be learned here. Let us go down.”“What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?” I asked, eagerly,when we had regained the lower room once more.“My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,” said he, with a touchof impatience. “You know my methods. Apply them, and it will beinstructive to compare results.”“I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,” I answered.“It will be clear enough to you soon,” he said, in an off-hand way. “Ithink that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.”He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the roomon his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long thin noseonly a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming anddeep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and furtive were hismovements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent,that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have madehad he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead ofexerting them in its defence. As he hunted about, he kept muttering tohimself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.“We are certainly in luck,” said he. “We ought to have very littletrouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in thecreosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here atthe side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked, Yousee, and the stuff has leaked out.”“What then?” I asked.“Why, we have got him, that’s all,” said he. “I know a dog that wouldfollow that scent to the world’s end. If a pack can track a trailedherring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow sopungent a smell as this? It sounds like a sum in the rule of three. Theanswer should give us the—But halloa! here are the accreditedrepresentatives of the law.”Heavy steps and the clamour of loud voices were audible from below, andthe hall door shut with a loud crash.“Before they come,” said Holmes, “just put your hand here on this poorfellow’s arm, and here on his leg. What do you feel?”“The muscles are as hard as a board,” I answered.“Quite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceedingthe usual _rigor mortis_. Coupled with this distortion of the face,this Hippocratic smile, or ‘_risus sardonicus_,’ as the old writerscalled it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?”“Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,” I answered,—“somestrychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.”“That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawnmuscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for themeans by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, Idiscovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great forceinto the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which wouldbe turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in hischair. Now examine the thorn.”I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It waslong, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as thoughsome gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been trimmedand rounded off with a knife.“Is that an English thorn?” he asked.“No, it certainly is not.”“With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference.But here are the regulars; so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.”As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly onthe passage, and a very stout, portly man in a grey suit strode heavilyinto the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair ofvery small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollenand puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform,and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.“Here’s a business!” he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. “Here’s apretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be asfull as a rabbit-warren!”“I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,” said Holmes,quietly.“Why, of course I do!” he wheezed. “It’s Mr. Sherlock Holmes, thetheorist. Remember you! I’ll never forget how you lectured us all oncauses and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It’strue you set us on the right track; but you’ll own now that it was moreby good luck than good guidance.”“It was a piece of very simple reasoning.”“Oh, come, now, come! Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all this?Bad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,—no room for theories. Howlucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case! I was atthe station when the message arrived. What d’you think the man diedof?”“Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorise over,” said Holmes,dryly.“No, no. Still, we can’t deny that you hit the nail on the headsometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half amillion missing. How was the window?”“Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.”“Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do withthe matter. That’s common sense. Man might have died in a fit; but thenthe jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashes come upon meat times.—Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. Your friendcan remain.—What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto was, on his ownconfession, with his brother last night. The brother died in a fit, onwhich Sholto walked off with the treasure. How’s that?”“On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door onthe inside.”“Hum! There’s a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter.This Thaddeus Sholto _was_ with his brother; there _was_ a quarrel; somuch we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much alsowe know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. Hisbed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbedstate of mind. His appearance is—well, not attractive. You see that Iam weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him.”“You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,” said Holmes. “Thissplinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned,was in the man’s scalp where you still see the mark; this card,inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay thisrather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into yourtheory?”“Confirms it in every respect,” said the fat detective, pompously.“House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and ifthis splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous useof it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus,—a blind, as likeas not. The only question is, how did he depart? Ah, of course, here isa hole in the roof.” With great activity, considering his bulk, hesprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, andimmediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that hehad found the trap-door.“He can find something,” remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. “Hehas occasional glimmerings of reason. _Il n’y a pas des sots siincommodes que ceux qui ont de l’esprit!_”“You see!” said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again.“Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case isconfirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it ispartly open.”“It was I who opened it.”“Oh, indeed! You did notice it, then?” He seemed a little crestfallenat the discovery. “Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentlemangot away. Inspector!”“Yes, sir,” from the passage.“Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.—Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to informyou that anything which you may say will be used against you. I arrestyou in the Queen’s name as being concerned in the death of yourbrother.”“There, now! Didn’t I tell you!” cried the poor little man, throwingout his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.“Don’t trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,” said Holmes. “I thinkthat I can engage to clear you of the charge.”“Don’t promise too much, Mr. Theorist,—don’t promise too much!” snappedthe detective. “You may find it a harder matter than you think.”“Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a freepresent of the name and description of one of the two people who werein this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, isJonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with hisright leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon theinner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an ironband round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and hasbeen a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you,coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing fromthe palm of his hand. The other man—”“Ah! the other man—?” asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, butimpressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of theother’s manner.“Is a rather curious person,” said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon hisheel. “I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pairof them.—A word with you, Watson.”He led me out to the head of the stair. “This unexpected occurrence,”he said, “has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose ofour journey.”“I have just been thinking so,” I answered. “It is not right that MissMorstan should remain in this stricken house.”“No. You must escort her home. She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, inLower Camberwell: so it is not very far. I will wait for you here ifyou will drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?”“By no means. I don’t think I could rest until I know more of thisfantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life,but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprisesto-night has shaken my nerve completely. I should like, however, to seethe matter through with you, now that I have got so far.”“Your presence will be of great service to me,” he answered. “We shallwork the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exultover any mare’s-nest which he may choose to construct. When you havedropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3, Pinchin Lane, downnear the water’s edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-handside is a bird-stuffer’s: Sherman is the name. You will see a weaselholding a young rabbit in the window. Knock old Sherman up, and tellhim, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. You will bring Tobyback in the cab with you.”“A dog, I suppose.”“Yes,—a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent. I wouldrather have Toby’s help than that of the whole detective force ofLondon.”“I shall bring him, then,” said I. “It is one now. I ought to be backbefore three, if I can get a fresh horse.”“And I,” said Holmes, “shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone,and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in thenext garret. Then I shall study the great Jones’s methods and listen tohis not too delicate sarcasms. ‘_Wir sind gewohnt das die Menschenverhöhnen was sie nicht verstehen._’ Goethe is always pithy.”Chapter VIIThe Episode of the BarrelThe police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted MissMorstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she hadborne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weakerthan herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by theside of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she firstturned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,—so sorely hadshe been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me sincethat she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She littleguessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraintwhich held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her, even asmy hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalitiesof life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had thisone day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts whichsealed the words of affection upon my lips. She was weak and helpless,shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage toobtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still, she was rich. IfHolmes’s researches were successful, she would be an heiress. Was itfair, was it honourable, that a half-pay surgeon should take suchadvantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about? Might she notlook upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could not bear to riskthat such a thought should cross her mind. This Agra treasureintervened like an impassable barrier between us.It was nearly two o’clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester’s. Theservants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been sointerested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received thatshe had sat up in the hope of her return. She opened the door herself,a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderlyher arm stole round the other’s waist and how motherly was the voice inwhich she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependant, but anhonoured friend. I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly beggedme to step in and tell her our adventures. I explained, however, theimportance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report anyprogress which we might make with the case. As we drove away I stole aglance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, thetwo graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall-lightshining through stained glass, the barometer, and the brightstair-rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of atranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which hadabsorbed us.And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker itgrew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as Irattled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was the originalproblem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of CaptainMorstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,—wehad had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, toa deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curiousplan found among Morstan’s baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto’sdeath, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by themurder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to thecrime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card,corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan’s chart,—here was indeeda labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than myfellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lowerquarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before Icould make my impression. At last, however, there was the glint of acandle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.“Go on, you drunken vagabone,” said the face. “If you kick up any morerow I’ll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.”“If you’ll let one out it’s just what I have come for,” said I.“Go on!” yelled the voice. “So help me gracious, I have a wiper in thebag, an’ I’ll drop it on your ’ead if you don’t hook it.”“But I want a dog,” I cried.“I won’t be argued with!” shouted Mr. Sherman. “Now stand clear, forwhen I say ‘three,’ down goes the wiper.”“Mr. Sherlock Holmes—” I began, but the words had a most magicaleffect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute thedoor was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, withstooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.“A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,” said he. “Step in, sir.Keep clear of the badger; for he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty, would youtake a nip at the gentleman?” This to a stoat which thrust its wickedhead and red eyes between the bars of its cage. “Don’t mind that, sir:it’s only a slow-worm. It hain’t got no fangs, so I gives it the run o’the room, for it keeps the beetles down. You must not mind my bein’just a little short wi’ you at first, for I’m guyed at by the children,and there’s many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up. Whatwas it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?”“He wanted a dog of yours.”“Ah! that would be Toby.”“Yes, Toby was the name.”“Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here.” He moved slowly forward withhis candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered roundhim. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there wereglancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny andcorner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls,who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voicesdisturbed their slumbers.Toby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, halfspaniel and half lurcher, brown-and-white in colour, with a very clumsywaddling gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar whichthe old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance,it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanyingme. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myselfback once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had,I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto hadbeen marched off to the station. Two constables guarded the narrowgate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning thedetective’s name.Holmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets,smoking his pipe.“Ah, you have him there!” said he. “Good dog, then! Atheney Jones hasgone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. He hasarrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper,and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves, but for asergeant upstairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.”We tied Toby to the hall table, and re-ascended the stairs. The roomwas as he had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over thecentral figure. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner.“Lend me your bull’s-eye, sergeant,” said my companion. “Now tie thisbit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you.Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.—Just you carry them downwith you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip myhandkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into thegarret with me for a moment.”We clambered up through the hole. Holmes turned his light once moreupon the footsteps in the dust.“I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,” he said. “Do youobserve anything noteworthy about them?”“They belong,” I said, “to a child or a small woman.”“Apart from their size, though. Is there nothing else?”“They appear to be much as other footmarks.”“Not at all. Look here! This is the print of a right foot in the dust.Now I make one with my naked foot beside it. What is the chiefdifference?”“Your toes are all cramped together. The other print has each toedistinctly divided.”“Quite so. That is the point. Bear that in mind. Now, would you kindlystep over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work? Ishall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.”I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarrysmell.“That is where he put his foot in getting out. If _you_ can trace him,I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now run downstairs,loose the dog, and look out for Blondin.”By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on theroof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling veryslowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys,but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon theopposite side. When I made my way round there I found him seated at oneof the corner eaves.“That you, Watson?” he cried.“Yes.”“This is the place. What is that black thing down there?”“A water-barrel.”“Top on it?”“Yes.”“No sign of a ladder?”“No.”“Confound the fellow! It’s a most break-neck place. I ought to be ableto come down where he could climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty firm.Here goes, anyhow.”There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadilydown the side of the wall. Then with a light spring he came on to thebarrel, and from there to the earth.“It was easy to follow him,” he said, drawing on his stockings andboots. “Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry hehad dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.”The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven outof coloured grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it. Inshape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half adozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other,like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.“They are hellish things,” said he. “Look out that you don’t prickyourself. I’m delighted to have them, for the chances are that they areall he has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skinbefore long. I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself. Are you gamefor a six-mile trudge, Watson?”“Certainly,” I answered.“Your leg will stand it?”“Oh, yes.”“Here you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell it, Toby, smell it!” Hepushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog’s nose, while thecreature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comicalcock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the _bouquet_ of a famousvintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened astout cord to the mongrel’s collar, and led him to the foot of thewater-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high,tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in theair, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash andkept us at the top of our speed.The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see somedistance in the cold grey light. The square, massive house, with itsblack, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn,behind us. Our course led right across the grounds, in and out amongthe trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. Thewhole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had ablighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy whichhung over it.On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly,underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by ayoung beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had beenloosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon thelower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmesclambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon theother side.“There’s the print of wooden-leg’s hand,” he remarked, as I mounted upbeside him. “You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster.What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain sinceyesterday! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of theireight-and-twenty hours’ start.”I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the greattraffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. Myfears were soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved, butwaddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smellof the creasote rose high above all other contending scents.“Do not imagine,” said Holmes, “that I depend for my success in thiscase upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his footin the chemical. I have knowledge now which would enable me to tracethem in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and, sincefortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglectedit. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty littleintellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There mighthave been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpableclue.”“There is credit, and to spare,” said I. “I assure you, Holmes, that Imarvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, evenmore than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me tobe deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describewith such confidence the wooden-legged man?”“Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don’t wish to betheatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are incommand of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buriedtreasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named JonathanSmall. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in CaptainMorstan’s possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and hisassociates,—the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically calledit. Aided by this chart, the officers—or one of them—gets the treasureand brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some conditionunder which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not JonathanSmall get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart isdated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association withconvicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and hisassociates were themselves convicts and could not get away.”“But that is mere speculation,” said I.“It is more than that. It is the only hypothesis which covers thefacts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remainsat peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. Thenhe receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. Whatwas that?”“A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.”“Or had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known whattheir term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise tohim. What does he do then? He guards himself against a wooden-leggedman,—a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him,and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man’s name ison the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no otherwhite man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-leggedman is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you asbeing faulty?”“No: it is clear and concise.”“Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let uslook at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the doubleidea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of havinghis revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholtolived, and very possibly he established communications with some oneinside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen.Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could notfind out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew,save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Smalllearns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secretof the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makeshis way to the dying man’s window, and is only deterred from enteringby the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against thedead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers inthe hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, andfinally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon thecard. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the majorhe would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was nota common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates,something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarreconceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, andusually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you followall this?”“Very clearly.”“Now, what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep asecret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly heleaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes thediscovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We againtrace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, withhis wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room ofBartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curiousassociate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot intocreasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officerwith a damaged tendo Achillis.”“But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.”“Quite so. And rather to Jonathan’s disgust, to judge by the way hestamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge againstBartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have beensimply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter.There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of hiscompanion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so JonathanSmall left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, andfollowed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I candecipher them. Of course as to his personal appearance he must bemiddle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such anoven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the lengthof his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was theone point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw himat the window. I don’t know that there is anything else.”“The associate?”“Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know allabout it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is! See how that onelittle cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo.Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. Itshines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on astranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our pettyambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forcesof nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?”“Fairly so. I worked back to him through Carlyle.”“That was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes onecurious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of man’s realgreatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, yousee, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself aproof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter. You havenot a pistol, have you?”“I have my stick.”“It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we getto their lair. Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turnsnasty I shall shoot him dead.” He took out his revolver as he spoke,and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into theright-hand pocket of his jacket.We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down thehalf-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now,however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, wherelabourers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women weretaking down shutters and brushing door-steps. At the square-toppedcorner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking menwere emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after theirmorning wet. Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us aswe passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor tothe left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and anoccasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now foundourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through theside-streets to the east of the Oval. The men whom we pursued seemed tohave taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escapingobservation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallelside-street would serve their turn. At the foot of Kennington Lane theyhad edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street. Wherethe latter street turns into Knight’s Place, Toby ceased to advance,but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and theother drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. Then he waddledround in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask forsympathy in his embarrassment.“What the deuce is the matter with the dog?” growled Holmes. “Theysurely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.”“Perhaps they stood here for some time,” I suggested.“Ah! it’s all right. He’s off again,” said my companion, in a tone ofrelief.He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made uphis mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as hehad not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before,for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at hisleash and tried to break into a run. I cold see by the gleam inHolmes’s eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick andNelson’s large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here thedog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate intothe enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On the dog racedthrough sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, betweentwo wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon alarge barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it hadbeen brought. With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood uponthe cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign ofappreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolleywere smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with thesmell of creasote.Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burstsimultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.Chapter VIIIThe Baker Street Irregulars“What now?” I asked. “Toby has lost his character for infallibility.”“He acted according to his lights,” said Holmes, lifting him down fromthe barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard. “If you consider howmuch creasote is carted about London in one day, it is no great wonderthat our trail should have been crossed. It is much used now,especially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to blame.”“We must get on the main scent again, I suppose.”“Yes. And, fortunately, we have no distance to go. Evidently whatpuzzled the dog at the corner of Knight’s Place was that there were twodifferent trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one.It only remains to follow the other.”There was no difficulty about this. On leading Toby to the place wherehe had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finallydashed off in a fresh direction.“We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where thecreasote-barrel came from,” I observed.“I had thought of that. But you notice that he keeps on the pavement,whereas the barrel passed down the roadway. No, we are on the truescent now.”It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Placeand Prince’s Street. At the end of Broad Street it ran right down tothe water’s edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. Toby led us tothe very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the darkcurrent beyond.“We are out of luck,” said Holmes. “They have taken to a boat here.”Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on theedge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though hesniffed earnestly, he made no sign.Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a woodenplacard slung out through the second window. “Mordecai Smith” wasprinted across it in large letters, and, underneath, “Boats to hire bythe hour or day.” A second inscription above the door informed us thata steam launch was kept,—a statement which was confirmed by a greatpile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, andhis face assumed an ominous expression.“This looks bad,” said he. “These fellows are sharper than I expected.They seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear, beenpreconcerted management here.”He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little,curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish,red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand.“You come back and be washed, Jack,” she shouted. “Come back, you youngimp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he’ll letus hear of it.”“Dear little chap!” said Holmes, strategically. “What a rosy-cheekedyoung rascal! Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?”The youth pondered for a moment. “I’d like a shillin’,” said he.“Nothing you would like better?”“I’d like two shillin’ better,” the prodigy answered, after somethought.“Here you are, then! Catch!—A fine child, Mrs. Smith!”“Lor’ bless you, sir, he is that, and forward. He gets a’most too muchfor me to manage, ’specially when my man is away days at a time.”“Away, is he?” said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. “I am sorry forthat, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.”“He’s been away since yesterday mornin’, sir, and, truth to tell, I ambeginnin’ to feel frightened about him. But if it was about a boat,sir, maybe I could serve as well.”“I wanted to hire his steam launch.”“Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone.That’s what puzzles me; for I know there ain’t more coals in her thanwould take her to about Woolwich and back. If he’d been away in thebarge I’d ha’ thought nothin’; for many a time a job has taken him asfar as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin’ there he might ha’stayed over. But what good is a steam launch without coals?”“He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.”“He might, sir, but it weren’t his way. Many a time I’ve heard him callout at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don’t likethat wooden-legged man, wi’ his ugly face and outlandish talk. What didhe want always knockin’ about here for?”“A wooden-legged man?” said Holmes, with bland surprise.“Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that’s called more’n once for myold man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what’s more,my man knew he was comin’, for he had steam up in the launch. I tellyou straight, sir, I don’t feel easy in my mind about it.”“But, my dear Mrs. Smith,” said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, “Youare frightening yourself about nothing. How could you possibly tellthat it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? I don’t quiteunderstand how you can be so sure.”“His voice, sir. I knew his voice, which is kind o’ thick and foggy. Hetapped at the winder,—about three it would be. ‘Show a leg, matey,’says he: ‘time to turn out guard.’ My old man woke up Jim,—that’s myeldest,—and away they went, without so much as a word to me. I couldhear the wooden leg clackin’ on the stones.”“And was this wooden-legged man alone?”“Couldn’t say, I am sure, sir. I didn’t hear no one else.”“I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heardgood reports of the—Let me see, what is her name?”“The _Aurora_, sir.”“Ah! She’s not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad inthe beam?”“No, indeed. She’s as trim a little thing as any on the river. She’sbeen fresh painted, black with two red streaks.”“Thanks. I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith. I am going downthe river; and if I should see anything of the _Aurora_ I shall let himknow that you are uneasy. A black funnel, you say?”“No, sir. Black with a white band.”“Ah, of course. It was the sides which were black. Good-morning, Mrs.Smith.—There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall take itand cross the river.“The main thing with people of that sort,” said Holmes, as we sat inthe sheets of the wherry, “is never to let them think that theirinformation can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do, theywill instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to them underprotest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.”“Our course now seems pretty clear,” said I.“What would you do, then?”“I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the_Aurora_.”“My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task. She may have touched atany wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich.Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places formiles. It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you setabout it alone.”“Employ the police, then.”“No. I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He isnot a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which wouldinjure him professionally. But I have a fancy for working it outmyself, now that we have gone so far.”“Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?”“Worse and worse! Our men would know that the chase was hot at theirheels, and they would be off out of the country. As it is, they arelikely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectlysafe they will be in no hurry. Jones’s energy will be of use to usthere, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the dailypress, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrongscent.”“What are we to do, then?” I asked, as we landed near MillbankPenitentiary.“Take this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour’ssleep. It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again.Stop at a telegraph-office, cabby! We will keep Toby, for he may be ofuse to us yet.”We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmesdespatched his wire. “Whom do you think that is to?” he asked, as weresumed our journey.“I am sure I don’t know.”“You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police forcewhom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?”“Well,” said I, laughing.“This is just the case where they might be invaluable. If they fail, Ihave other resources; but I shall try them first. That wire was to mydirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gangwill be with us before we have finished our breakfast.”It was between eight and nine o’clock now, and I was conscious of astrong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I waslimp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not theprofessional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I lookat the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as thedeath of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, andcould feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. The treasure,however, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belongedrightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it Iwas ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it itwould probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a pettyand selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that.If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold strongerreason to urge me on to find the treasure.A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me upwonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laidand Homes pouring out the coffee.“Here it is,” said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper.“The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it upbetween them. But you have had enough of the case. Better have your hamand eggs first.”I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed“Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood.”“About twelve o’clock last night,” said the _Standard_, “Mr.Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found deadin his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as wecan learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto’sperson, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceasedgentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. Thediscovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who hadcalled at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased.By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-knownmember of the detective police force, happened to be at the NorwoodPolice Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the firstalarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directedtowards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result thatthe brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together withthe housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and aporter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that thethief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones’swell-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observationhave enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could nothave entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their wayacross the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a roomwhich communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact,which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it wasno mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of theofficers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on suchoccasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but thinkthat it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see ourdetectives more decentralised, and so brought into closer and moreeffective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.”“Isn’t it gorgeous!” said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. “Whatdo you think of it?”“I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested forthe crime.”“So do I. I wouldn’t answer for our safety now, if he should happen tohave another of his attacks of energy.”At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs.Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation anddismay.“By heaven, Holmes,” I said, half rising, “I believe that they arereally after us.”“No, it’s not quite so bad as that. It is the unofficial force,—theBaker Street irregulars.”As he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon thestairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty andragged little street-Arabs. There was some show of discipline amongthem, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up inline and stood facing us with expectant faces. One of their number,taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of loungingsuperiority which was very funny in such a disreputable littlescarecrow.“Got your message, sir,” said he, “and brought ’em on sharp. Three boband a tanner for tickets.”“Here you are,” said Holmes, producing some silver. “In future they canreport to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house invadedin this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear theinstructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch calledthe _Aurora_, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnelblack with a white band. She is down the river somewhere. I want oneboy to be at Mordecai Smith’s landing-stage opposite Millbank to say ifthe boat comes back. You must divide it out among yourselves, and doboth banks thoroughly. Let me know the moment you have news. Is thatall clear?”“Yes, guv’nor,” said Wiggins.“The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat.Here’s a day in advance. Now off you go!” He handed them a shillingeach, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a momentlater streaming down the street.“If the launch is above water they will find her,” said Holmes, as herose from the table and lit his pipe. “They can go everywhere, seeeverything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening thatthey have spotted her. In the meanwhile, we can do nothing but awaitresults. We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the_Aurora_ or Mr. Mordecai Smith.”“Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say. Are you going to bed,Holmes?”“No; I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never rememberfeeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I amgoing to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fairclient has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of oursought to be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other manmust, I should think, be absolutely unique.”“That other man again!”“I have no wish to make a mystery of him,—to you, anyway. But you musthave formed your own opinion. Now, do consider the data. Diminutivefootmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet, stone-headedwooden mace, great agility, small poisoned darts. What do you make ofall this?”“A savage!” I exclaimed. “Perhaps one of those Indians who were theassociates of Jonathan Small.”“Hardly that,” said he. “When first I saw signs of strange weapons Iwas inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarkscaused me to reconsider my views. Some of the inhabitants of the IndianPeninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that.The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-wearing Mohammedanhas the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong iscommonly passed between. These little darts, too, could only be shot inone way. They are from a blow-pipe. Now, then, where are we to find oursavage?”“South American,” I hazarded.He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf.“This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published.It may be looked upon as the very latest authority. What have we here?‘Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in theBay of Bengal.’ Hum! hum! What’s all this? Moist climate, coral reefs,sharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods—Ah,here we are. ‘The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claimthe distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though someanthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the Digger Indians ofAmerica, and the Terra del Fuegians. The average height is rather belowfour feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are verymuch smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractablepeople, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when theirconfidence has once been gained.’ Mark that, Watson. Now, then, listento this. ‘They are naturally hideous, having large, misshapen heads,small, fierce eyes, and distorted features. Their feet and hands,however, are remarkably small. So intractable and fierce are they thatall the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over inany degree. They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews,braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting themwith their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded bya cannibal feast.’ Nice, amiable people, Watson! If this fellow hadbeen left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken aneven more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Smallwould give a good deal not to have employed him.”“But how came he to have so singular a companion?”“Ah, that is more than I can tell. Since, however, we had alreadydetermined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so verywonderful that this islander should be with him. No doubt we shall knowall about it in time. Look here, Watson; you look regularly done. Liedown there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.”He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out hebegan to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,—his own, no doubt, forhe had a remarkable gift for improvisation. I have a vague remembranceof his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow.Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound,until I found myself in dreamland, with the sweet face of Mary Morstanlooking down upon me.Chapter IXA Break in the ChainIt was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed.Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he hadlaid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked across at me,as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.“You have slept soundly,” he said. “I feared that our talk would wakeyou.”“I heard nothing,” I answered. “Have you had fresh news, then?”“Unfortunately, no. I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. Iexpected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up toreport. He says that no trace can be found of the launch. It is aprovoking check, for every hour is of importance.”“Can I do anything? I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready foranother night’s outing.”“No, we can do nothing. We can only wait. If we go ourselves, themessage might come in our absence, and delay be caused. You can do whatyou will, but I must remain on guard.”“Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. CecilForrester. She asked me to, yesterday.”“On Mrs. Cecil Forrester?” asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile inhis eyes.“Well, of course Miss Morstan too. They were anxious to hear whathappened.”“I would not tell them too much,” said Holmes. “Women are never to beentirely trusted,—not the best of them.”I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. “I shall beback in an hour or two,” I remarked.“All right! Good luck! But, I say, if you are crossing the river youmay as well return Toby, for I don’t think it is at all likely that weshall have any use for him now.”I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with ahalf-sovereign, at the old naturalist’s in Pinchin Lane. At CamberwellI found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night’s adventures, butvery eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, was full ofcuriosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, themore dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr.Sholto’s death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it.With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amazethem.“It is a romance!” cried Mrs. Forrester. “An injured lady, half amillion in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian.They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.”“And two knight-errants to the rescue,” added Miss Morstan, with abright glance at me.“Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don’tthink that you are nearly excited enough. Just imagine what it must beto be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!”It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed nosign of elation at the prospect. On the contrary, she gave a toss ofher proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took smallinterest.“It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,” she said. “Nothingelse is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindlyand honourably throughout. It is our duty to clear him of this dreadfuland unfounded charge.”It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time Ireached home. My companion’s book and pipe lay by his chair, but he haddisappeared. I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but there wasnone.“I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,” I said to Mrs.Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds.“No, sir. He has gone to his room, sir. Do you know, sir,” sinking hervoice into an impressive whisper, “I am afraid for his health?”“Why so, Mrs. Hudson?”“Well, he’s that strange, sir. After you was gone he walked and hewalked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound ofhis footstep. Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering, andevery time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with ‘What isthat, Mrs. Hudson?’ And now he has slammed off to his room, but I canhear him walking away the same as ever. I hope he’s not going to beill, sir. I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine,but he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don’t know how ever Igot out of the room.”“I don’t think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,” Ianswered. “I have seen him like this before. He has some small matterupon his mind which makes him restless.” I tried to speak lightly toour worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through thelong night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread,and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntaryinaction.At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck offeverish colour upon either cheek.“You are knocking yourself up, old man,” I remarked. “I heard youmarching about in the night.”“No, I could not sleep,” he answered. “This infernal problem isconsuming me. It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle, whenall else had been overcome. I know the men, the launch, everything; andyet I can get no news. I have set other agencies at work, and usedevery means at my disposal. The whole river has been searched on eitherside, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband. Ishall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft.But there are objections to that.”“Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.”“No, I think that may be dismissed. I had inquiries made, and there isa launch of that description.”“Could it have gone up the river?”“I have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-partywho will work up as far as Richmond. If no news comes to-day, I shallstart off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat.But surely, surely, we shall hear something.”We did not, however. Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or fromthe other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon theNorwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile to theunfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found,however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon thefollowing day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report ourill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected andsomewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions, and busiedhimself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involvedmuch heating of retorts and distilling of vapours, ending at last in asmell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hoursof the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which toldme that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find himstanding by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket,and a coarse red scarf round his neck.“I am off down the river, Watson,” said he. “I have been turning itover in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worthtrying, at all events.”“Surely I can come with you, then?” said I.“No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as myrepresentative. I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards thatsome message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondentabout it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and toact on your own judgment if any news should come. Can I rely upon you?”“Most certainly.”“I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardlytell yet where I may find myself. If I am in luck, however, I may notbe gone so very long. I shall have news of some sort or other before Iget back.”I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time. On opening the_Standard_, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to thebusiness. “With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,” it remarked,“we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even morecomplex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence hasshown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could havebeen in any way concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs.Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed,however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and thatit is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, withall his well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may be expectedat any moment.”“That is satisfactory so far as it goes,” thought I. “Friend Sholto issafe, at any rate. I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it seemsto be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder.”I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eyecaught an advertisement in the agony column. It ran in this way:“Lost.—Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith’sWharf at or about three o’clock last Tuesday morning in the steamlaunch _Aurora_, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a whiteband, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can giveinformation to Mrs. Smith, at Smith’s Wharf, or at 221_b_ Baker Street,as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch_Aurora_.”This was clearly Holmes’s doing. The Baker Street address was enough toprove that. It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be readby the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the naturalanxiety of a wife for her missing husband.It was a long day. Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharpstep passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmesreturning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but mythoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assortedand villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered,some radical flaw in my companion’s reasoning. Might he be sufferingfrom some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble andspeculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? Ihad never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner mayoccasionally be deceived. He was likely, I thought, to fall into errorthrough the over-refinement of his logic,—his preference for a subtleand bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one layready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen theevidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. When I lookedback on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivialin themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could notdisguise from myself that even if Holmes’s explanation were incorrectthe true theory must be equally _outré_ and startling.At three o’clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, anauthoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a personthan Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he,however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense whohad taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expressionwas downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.“Good-day, sir; good-day,” said he. “Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, Iunderstand.”“Yes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back. But perhaps you wouldcare to wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars.”“Thank you; I don’t mind if I do,” said he, mopping his face with a redbandanna handkerchief.“And a whiskey-and-soda?”“Well, half a glass. It is very hot for the time of year; and I havehad a good deal to worry and try me. You know my theory about thisNorwood case?”“I remember that you expressed one.”“Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it. I had my net drawn tightlyround Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the middle ofit. He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. From thetime that he left his brother’s room he was never out of sight of someone or other. So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and throughtrap-doors. It’s a very dark case, and my professional credit is atstake. I should be very glad of a little assistance.”“We all need help sometimes,” said I.“Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,” said he, ina husky and confidential voice. “He’s a man who is not to be beat. Ihave known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never sawthe case yet that he could not throw a light upon. He is irregular inhis methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, onthe whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and Idon’t care who knows it. I have had a wire from him this morning, bywhich I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business.Here is the message.”He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me. It wasdated from Poplar at twelve o’clock. “Go to Baker Street at once,” itsaid. “If I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the track ofthe Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night if you want to be in atthe finish.”“This sounds well. He has evidently picked up the scent again,” said I.“Ah, then he has been at fault too,” exclaimed Jones, with evidentsatisfaction. “Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes. Of coursethis may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer ofthe law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at the door.Perhaps this is he.”A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing andrattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once ortwice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but atlast he made his way to our door and entered. His appearancecorresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He was an aged man, cladin seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat.His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing waspainfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel hisshoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He had acoloured scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face savea pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long greyside-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectablemaster mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.“What is it, my man?” I asked.He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.“Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?” said he.“No; but I am acting for him. You can tell me any message you have forhim.”“It was to him himself I was to tell it,” said he.“But I tell you that I am acting for him. Was it about Mordecai Smith’sboat?”“Yes. I knows well where it is. An’ I knows where the men he is afterare. An’ I knows where the treasure is. I knows all about it.”“Then tell me, and I shall let him know.”“It was to him I was to tell it,” he repeated, with the petulantobstinacy of a very old man.“Well, you must wait for him.”“No, no; I ain’t goin’ to lose a whole day to please no one. If Mr.Holmes ain’t here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself. Idon’t care about the look of either of you, and I won’t tell a word.”He shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him.“Wait a bit, my friend,” said he. “You have important information, andyou must not walk off. We shall keep you, whether you like or not,until our friend returns.”The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jonesput his broad back up against it, he recognised the uselessness ofresistance.“Pretty sort o’ treatment this!” he cried, stamping his stick. “I comehere to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seizeme and treat me in this fashion!”“You will be none the worse,” I said. “We shall recompense you for theloss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not havelong to wait.”He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his faceresting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.Suddenly, however, Holmes’s voice broke in upon us.“I think that you might offer me a cigar too,” he said.We both started in our chairs. There was Holmes sitting close to uswith an air of quiet amusement.“Holmes!” I exclaimed. “You here! But where is the old man?”“Here is the old man,” said he, holding out a heap of white hair. “Herehe is,—wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise waspretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.”“Ah, You rogue!” cried Jones, highly delighted. “You would have made anactor, and a rare one. You had the proper workhouse cough, and thoseweak legs of yours are worth ten pounds a week. I thought I knew theglint of your eye, though. You didn’t get away from us so easily, Yousee.”“I have been working in that get-up all day,” said he, lighting hiscigar. “You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to knowme,—especially since our friend here took to publishing some of mycases: so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise likethis. You got my wire?”“Yes; that was what brought me here.”“How has your case prospered?”“It has all come to nothing. I have had to release two of my prisoners,and there is no evidence against the other two.”“Never mind. We shall give you two others in the place of them. But youmust put yourself under my orders. You are welcome to all the officialcredit, but you must act on the line that I point out. Is that agreed?”“Entirely, if you will help me to the men.”“Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat—a steamlaunch—to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o’clock.”“That is easily managed. There is always one about there; but I canstep across the road and telephone to make sure.”“Then I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance.”“There will be two or three in the boat. What else?”“When we secure the men we shall get the treasure. I think that itwould be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to theyoung lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her be the firstto open it.—Eh, Watson?”“It would be a great pleasure to me.”“Rather an irregular proceeding,” said Jones, shaking his head.“However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink atit. The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authoritiesuntil after the official investigation.”“Certainly. That is easily managed. One other point. I should much liketo have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Smallhimself. You know I like to work the detail of my cases out. There isno objection to my having an unofficial interview with him, either herein my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently guarded?”“Well, you are master of the situation. I have had no proof yet of theexistence of this Jonathan Small. However, if you can catch him I don’tsee how I can refuse you an interview with him.”“That is understood, then?”“Perfectly. Is there anything else?”“Only that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in halfan hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a littlechoice in white wines.—Watson, you have never yet recognised my meritsas a housekeeper.”Chapter XThe End of the IslanderOur meal was a merry one. Holmes could talk exceedingly well when hechose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state ofnervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on aquick succession of subjects,—on miracle-plays, on mediæval pottery, onStradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-shipsof the future,—handling each as though he had made a special study ofit. His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression ofthe preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in hishours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the air of a _bonvivant_. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearingthe end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes’s gaiety. None ofus alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled upthree glasses with port. “One bumper,” said he, “to the success of ourlittle expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you apistol, Watson?”“I have my old service-revolver in my desk.”“You had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that thecab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six.”It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, andfound our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically.“Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?”“Yes,—that green lamp at the side.”“Then take it off.”The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were castoff. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at therudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectorsforward.“Where to?” asked Jones.“To the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson’s Yard.”Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines ofloaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled withsatisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us.“We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,” he said.“Well, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.”“We shall have to catch the _Aurora_, and she has a name for being aclipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect howannoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?”“Yes.”“Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemicalanalysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of workis the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving thehydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of theSholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been upthe river and down the river without result. The launch was not at anylanding-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly havebeen scuttled to hide their traces,—though that always remained as apossible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had acertain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable ofanything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a productof higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly beenin London some time—as we had evidence that he maintained a continualwatch over Pondicherry Lodge—he could hardly leave at a moment’snotice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, toarrange his affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate.”“It seems to me to be a little weak,” said I. “It is more probable thathe had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon hisexpedition.”“No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable aretreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that hecould do without it. But a second consideration struck me. JonathanSmall must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion,however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, andpossibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharpenough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters undercover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broadlight. Now, it was past three o’clock, according to Mrs. Smith, whenthey got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be aboutin an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. Theypaid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the finalescape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In acouple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took,and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way undercover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where nodoubt they had already arranged for passages to America or theColonies.”“But the launch? They could not have taken that to their lodgings.”“Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spiteof its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, andlooked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probably considerthat to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would makepursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then,could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? Iwondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could onlythink of one way of doing it. I might land the launch over to someboat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change inher. She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so beeffectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a fewhours’ notice.”“That seems simple enough.”“It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to beoverlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at oncein this harmless seaman’s rig and inquired at all the yards down theriver. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth—Jacobson’s—Ilearned that the _Aurora_ had been handed over to them two days ago bya wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder.‘There ain’t naught amiss with her rudder,’ said the foreman. ‘Thereshe lies, with the red streaks.’ At that moment who should come downbut Mordecai Smith, the missing owner? He was rather the worse forliquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed outhis name and the name of his launch. ‘I want her to-night at eighto’clock,’ said he,—‘eight o’clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemenwho won’t be kept waiting.’ They had evidently paid him well, for hewas very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. Ifollowed him some distance, but he subsided into an ale-house: so Iwent back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on theway, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand atwater’s edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. We shallbe lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do nottake men, treasure, and all.”“You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men ornot,” said Jones; “but if the affair were in my hands I should have hada body of police in Jacobson’s Yard, and arrested them when they camedown.”“Which would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow.He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him suspicious liesnug for another week.”“But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to theirhiding-place,” said I.“In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundredto one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has liquorand good pay, why should he ask questions? They send him messages whatto do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.”While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting thelong series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the City thelast rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St.Paul’s. It was twilight before we reached the Tower.“That is Jacobson’s Yard,” said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of mastsand rigging on the Surrey side. “Cruise gently up and down here undercover of this string of lighters.” He took a pair of night-glasses fromhis pocket and gazed some time at the shore. “I see my sentry at hispost,” he remarked, “but no sign of a handkerchief.”“Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,” saidJones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policemen andstokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.“We have no right to take anything for granted,” Holmes answered. “Itis certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot becertain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and theycan hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light. Wemust stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in thegaslight.”“They are coming from work in the yard.”“Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some littleimmortal spark concealed about him. You would not think it, to look atthem. There is no _a priori_ probability about it. A strange enigma isman!”“Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,” I suggested.“Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,” said Holmes. “He remarksthat, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregatehe becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, neverforetell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision whatan average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentagesremain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief?Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.”“Yes, it is your boy,” I cried. “I can see him plainly.”“And there is the _Aurora_,” exclaimed Holmes, “and going like thedevil! Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with theyellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves tohave the heels of us!”She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind twoor three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before wesaw her. Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore,going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and shook hishead.“She is very fast,” he said. “I doubt if we shall catch her.”“We _must_ catch her!” cried Holmes, between his teeth. “Heap it on,stokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must havethem!”We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerfulengines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp,steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves toright and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprang andquivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bowsthrew a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead adark blur upon the water showed where the _Aurora_ lay, and the swirlof white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. Weflashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behindthis one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, butstill the _Aurora_ thundered on, and still we followed close upon hertrack.“Pile it on, men, pile it on!” cried Holmes, looking down into theengine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,aquiline face. “Get every pound of steam you can.”“I think we gain a little,” said Jones, with his eyes on the _Aurora_.“I am sure of it,” said I. “We shall be up with her in a very fewminutes.”At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug withthree barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting ourhelm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could roundthem and recover our way the _Aurora_ had gained a good two hundredyards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertaintwilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our boilers werestrained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked withthe fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through thePool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and upagain after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of usresolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty _Aurora_. Jonesturned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see thefigures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something blackbetween his knees over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark masswhich looked like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller, whileagainst the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped tothe waist, and shovelling coals for dear life. They may have had somedoubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now aswe followed every winding and turning which they took there could nolonger be any question about it. At Greenwich we were about threehundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been morethan two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many creatures in manycountries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me sucha wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily wedrew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of the night we couldhear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the sternstill crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though hewere busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with aglance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came andnearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat’slengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was aclear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and themelancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in thestern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us,cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized,powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I couldsee that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon theright side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there wasmovement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itselfinto a little black man—the smallest I have ever seen—with a great,misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes hadalready drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of thissavage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulsteror blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enoughto give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen features so deeplymarked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed andburned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back fromhis teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.“Fire if he raises his hand,” said Holmes, quietly. We were within aboat’s-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. Ican see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legsfar apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with hishideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the lightof our lantern.It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked heplucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, likea school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang outtogether. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind ofchoking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse ofhis venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At thesame moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and putit hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank,while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We wereround after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank.It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wideexpanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds ofdecaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon themud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water.The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole lengthinto the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one stepcould he possibly take either forwards or backwards. He yelled inimpotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot,but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the stickybank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchoredthat it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders thatwe were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish,over our side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in theirlaunch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The _Aurora_herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern. A solid iron chest ofIndian workmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could be noquestion, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure ofthe Sholtos. There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so wetransferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowlyup-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction, butthere was no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at thebottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to ourshores.“See here,” said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. “We werehardly quick enough with our pistols.” There, sure enough, just behindwhere we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which weknew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant that wefired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easyfashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horribledeath which had passed so close to us that night.Chapter XIThe Great Agra TreasureOur captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had doneso much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-eyedfellow, with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahoganyfeatures, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singularprominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to beeasily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty orthereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with grey. Hisface in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows andaggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expressionwhen moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap,and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen,twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings.It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid andcontained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam ofsomething like humour in his eyes.“Well, Jonathan Small,” said Holmes, lighting a cigar, “I am sorry thatit has come to this.”“And so am I, sir,” he answered, frankly. “I don’t believe that I canswing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never raisedhand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shotone of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir. I was asgrieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the little devilwith the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could notundo it again.”“Have a cigar,” said Holmes; “and you had best take a pull out of myflask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak aman as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while youwere climbing the rope?”“You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truthis that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the housepretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down tohis supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defencethat I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had been the oldmajor I would have swung for him with a light heart. I would havethought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. But it’scursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom Ihad no quarrel whatever.”“You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. Heis going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a trueaccount of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if youdo I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that thepoison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reachedthe room.”“That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw himgrinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through thewindow. It fairly shook me, sir. I’d have half killed Tonga for it ifhe had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his club, andsome of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to putyou on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. Idon’t feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queerthing,” he added, with a bitter smile, “that I who have a fair claim tonigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of mylife building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend theother half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me whenfirst I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with theAgra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon theman who owned it. To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto it broughtfear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.”At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shouldersinto the tiny cabin. “Quite a family party,” he remarked. “I think Ishall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may allcongratulate each other. Pity we didn’t take the other alive; but therewas no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it ratherfine. It was all we could do to overhaul her.”“All is well that ends well,” said Holmes. “But I certainly did notknow that the _Aurora_ was such a clipper.”“Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and thatif he had had another man to help him with the engines we should neverhave caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business.”“Neither he did,” cried our prisoner,—“not a word. I chose his launchbecause I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, but we paidhim well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached ourvessel, the _Esmeralda_, at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazils.”“Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him.If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick incondemning them.” It was amusing to notice how the consequential Joneswas already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of thecapture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes’sface, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.“We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,” said Jones, “and shall landyou, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that Iam taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It ismost irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. I must,however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since youhave so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?”“Yes, I shall drive.”“It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. Youwill have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?”“At the bottom of the river,” said Small, shortly.“Hum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We havehad work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warnyou to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Streetrooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station.”They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff,genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour’s drive broughtus to Mrs. Cecil Forrester’s. The servant seemed surprised at so late avisitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained,and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in thedrawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving theobliging inspector in the cab.She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of whitediaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck andwaist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned backin the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tintingwith a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. Onewhite arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her wholepose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of myfoot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush ofsurprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks.“I heard a cab drive up,” she said. “I thought that Mrs. Forrester hadcome back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you. Whatnews have you brought me?”“I have brought something better than news,” said I, putting down thebox upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though myheart was heavy within me. “I have brought you something which is worthall the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune.”She glanced at the iron box. “Is that the treasure, then?” she asked,coolly enough.“Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half isThaddeus Sholto’s. You will have a couple of hundred thousand each.Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be fewricher young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?”I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and thatshe detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw hereyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.“If I have it,” said she, “I owe it to you.”“No, no,” I answered, “not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a cluewhich has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearlylost it at the last moment.”“Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,” said she.I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen herlast,—Holmes’s new method of search, the discovery of the _Aurora_, theappearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and thewild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and shiningeyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the dart whichhad so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that shewas about to faint.“It is nothing,” she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water. “Iam all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed myfriends in such horrible peril.”“That is all over,” I answered. “It was nothing. I will tell you nomore gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is thetreasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring itwith me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to seeit.”“It would be of the greatest interest to me,” she said. There was noeagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that itmight seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize whichhad cost so much to win.“What a pretty box!” she said, stooping over it. “This is Indian work,I suppose?”“Yes; it is Benares metal-work.”“And so heavy!” she exclaimed, trying to raise it. “The box alone mustbe of some value. Where is the key?”“Small threw it into the Thames,” I answered. “I must borrow Mrs.Forrester’s poker.” There was in the front a thick and broad hasp,wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the endof the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang openwith a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We bothstood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty!No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inchthick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chestconstructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumbof metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and completelyempty.“The treasure is lost,” said Miss Morstan, calmly.As I listened to the words and realised what they meant, a great shadowseemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure hadweighed me down, until now that it was finally removed. It was selfish,no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realise nothing save that thegolden barrier was gone from between us. “Thank God!” I ejaculated frommy very heart.She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. “Why do you saythat?” she asked.“Because you are within my reach again,” I said, taking her hand. Shedid not withdraw it. “Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a manloved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Nowthat they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said,‘Thank God.’”“Then I say, ‘Thank God,’ too,” she whispered, as I drew her to myside. Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gainedone.Chapter XIIThe Strange Story of Jonathan SmallA very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a wearytime before I rejoined him. His face clouded over when I showed him theempty box.“There goes the reward!” said he, gloomily. “Where there is no moneythere is no pay. This night’s work would have been worth a tenner eachto Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.”“Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,” I said. “He will see that you arerewarded, treasure or no.”The inspector shook his head despondently, however. “It’s a bad job,”he repeated; “and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.”His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blankenough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. Theyhad only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they hadchanged their plans so far as to report themselves at a station uponthe way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listlessexpression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his woodenleg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty box he leanedback in his chair and laughed aloud.“This is your doing, Small,” said Athelney Jones, angrily.“Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,” hecried, exultantly. “It is my treasure; and if I can’t have the lootI’ll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that noliving man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in theAndaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have theuse of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through forthem as much as for myself. It’s been the sign of four with us always.Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, andthrow the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kinof Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did forAchmet. You’ll find the treasure where the key is, and where littleTonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the lootaway in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this journey.”“You are deceiving us, Small,” said Athelney Jones, sternly. “If youhad wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have beeneasier for you to have thrown box and all.”“Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,” he answered,with a shrewd, sidelong look. “The man that was clever enough to huntme down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of ariver. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be aharder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad whenyou came up with us. However, there’s no good grieving over it. I’vehad ups in my life, and I’ve had downs, but I’ve learned not to cryover spilled milk.”“This is a very serious matter, Small,” said the detective. “If you hadhelped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have hada better chance at your trial.”“Justice!” snarled the ex-convict. “A pretty justice! Whose loot isthis, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it upto those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it! Twentylong years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under themangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bittenby mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-facedpoliceman who loved to take it out of a white man. That was how Iearned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because Icannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another mayenjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga’sdarts in my hide, than live in a convict’s cell and feel that anotherman is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine.”Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wildwhirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clankedtogether with the impassioned movement of his hands. I couldunderstand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it wasno groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto whenhe first learned that the injured convict was upon his track.“You forget that we know nothing of all this,” said Holmes quietly. “Wehave not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice mayoriginally have been on your side.”“Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see thatI have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists. Still,I bear no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. If you wantto hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you isGod’s truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put the glass besideme here, and I’ll put my lips to it if I am dry.“I am a Worcestershire man myself,—born near Pershore. I dare say youwould find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look. Ihave often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is thatI was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they wouldbe so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk,small farmers, well-known and respected over the country-side, while Iwas always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I was abouteighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over agirl, and could only get out of it again by taking the Queen’s shillingand joining the 3rd Buffs, which was just starting for India.“I wasn’t destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got pastthe goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enoughto go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company sergeant, JohnHolder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the finestswimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, just as I was half-wayacross, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could havedone it, just above the knee. What with the shock and the loss ofblood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder had not caught holdof me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in hospital over it,and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toestrapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army andunfitted for any active occupation.“I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for Iwas a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year. However, mymisfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named AbelWhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseerto look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He happenedto be a friend of our colonel’s, who had taken an interest in me sincethe accident. To make a long story short, the colonel recommended mestrongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be done onhorseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left tokeep good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over theplantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report theidlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether Iwas content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting. Mr.Abel White was a kind man, and he would often drop into my littleshanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel theirhearts warm to each other as they never do here at home.“Well, I was never in luck’s way long. Suddenly, without a note ofwarning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as stilland peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there weretwo hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was aperfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,—a deal morethan I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know whatI saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra,near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the wholesky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we hadsmall companies of Europeans passing through our estate with theirwives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearesttroops. Mr. Abel White was an obstinate man. He had it in his head thatthe affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over assuddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinkingwhiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blazeabout him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife,used to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crashcame. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowlyhome in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddledtogether at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what itwas, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson’swife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs.A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face,quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lyingacross each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wonderingwhich way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curlingup from Abel White’s bungalow and the flames beginning to burst throughthe roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but wouldonly throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where Istood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coatsstill on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Someof them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so Ibroke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safewithin the walls at Agra.“As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. Thewhole country was up like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English couldcollect in little bands they held just the ground that their gunscommanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fightof the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it wasthat these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, wereour own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our ownweapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3rdBengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery ofartillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed,and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebelsat Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but ourpowder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city.“Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side,—which is not tobe wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we wereright in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better than a hundred milesto the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From every pointon the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage.“The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fiercedevil-worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among thenarrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore,and took up his position in the old fort at Agra. I don’t know if anyof you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. Itis a very queer place,—the queerest that ever I was in, and I have beenin some rum corners, too. First of all, it is enormous in size. Ishould think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is amodern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, andeverything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part isnothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and whichis given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. It is all full ofgreat deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twistingin and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it. Forthis reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now andagain a party with torches might go exploring.“The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it,but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to beguarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which wasactually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly menenough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It wasimpossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one ofthe innumerable gates. What we did was to organise a centralguard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under thecharge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected totake charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated doorupon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placedunder my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to firemy musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the centralguard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and asthe space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages andcorridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in timeto be of any use in case of an actual attack.“Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, sinceI was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights Ikept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall, fierce-lookingchaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-menwho had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They could talkEnglish pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferredto stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. Formyself, I used to stand outside the gateway, looking down on the broad,winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. Thebeating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of therebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us allnight of our dangerous neighbours across the stream. Every two hoursthe officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to makesure that all was well.“The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, drivingrain. It was dreary work standing in the gateway hour after hour insuch weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, butwithout much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed, andbroke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that mycompanions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, andlaid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhswere upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at myhead, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore betweenhis teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step.“My first thought was that these fellows were in league with therebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our door werein the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women andchildren be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen thinkthat I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my wordthat when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at mythroat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if itwas my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held meseemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, hewhispered, ‘Don’t make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are norebel dogs on this side of the river.’ There was the ring of truth inwhat he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. Icould read it in the fellow’s brown eyes. I waited, therefore, insilence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.“‘Listen to me, Sahib,’ said the taller and fiercer of the pair, theone whom they called Abdullah Khan. ‘You must either be with us now oryou must be silenced forever. The thing is too great a one for us tohesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on thecross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown intothe ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army.There is no middle way. Which is it to be, death or life? We can onlygive you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all mustbe done before the rounds come again.’“‘How can I decide?’ said I. ‘You have not told me what you want of me.But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of thefort I will have no truck with it, so you can drive home your knife andwelcome.’“‘It is nothing against the fort,’ said he. ‘We only ask you to do thatwhich your countrymen come to this land for. We ask you to be rich. Ifyou will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon the nakedknife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break,that you shall have your fair share of the loot. A quarter of thetreasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.’“‘But what is the treasure, then?’ I asked. ‘I am as ready to be richas you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.’“‘You will swear, then,’ said he, ‘by the bones of your father, by thehonour of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand andspeak no word against us, either now or afterwards?’“‘I will swear it,’ I answered, ‘provided that the fort is notendangered.’“‘Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of thetreasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.’“‘There are but three,’ said I.“‘No; Dost Akbar must have his share. We can tell the tale to you whilewe await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give noticeof their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to youbecause I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that wemay trust you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by allthe gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon theknife, and your body in the water. But the Sikh knows the Englishman,and the Englishman knows the Sikh. Hearken, then, to what I have tosay.“‘There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth,though his lands are small. Much has come to him from his father, andmore still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoardshis gold rather than spend it. When the troubles broke out he would befriends both with the lion and the tiger,—with the Sepoy and with theCompany’s Raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men’s daywas come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but oftheir death and their overthrow. Yet, being a careful man, he made suchplans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should beleft to him. That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in thevaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicestpearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trustyservant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fortat Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebelswon he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewelswould be saved to him. Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himselfinto the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders.By doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of thosewho have been true to their salt.“‘This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is nowin the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort. He haswith him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, whoknows his secret. Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to aside-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose. Herehe will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and myselfawaiting him. The place is lonely, and none shall know of his coming.The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the greattreasure of the rajah shall be divided among us. What say you to it,Sahib?’“In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing;but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you andyou have been used to meeting death at every turn. Whether Achmet themerchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at thetalk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what Imight do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare whenthey saw their ne’er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of goldmoidores. I had, therefore, already made up my mind. Abdullah Khan,however, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely.“‘Consider, Sahib,’ said he, ‘that if this man is taken by thecommandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by thegovernment, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now,since we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well?The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company’s coffers. Therewill be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. Noone can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men.What could be better for the purpose? Say again, then, Sahib, whetheryou are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.’“‘I am with you heart and soul,’ said I.“‘It is well,’ he answered, handing me back my firelock. ‘You see thatwe trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We havenow only to wait for my brother and the merchant.’“‘Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?’ I asked.“‘The plan is his. He has devised it. We will go to the gate and sharethe watch with Mahomet Singh.’“The rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning ofthe wet season. Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, andit was hard to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay in front ofour door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it couldeasily be crossed. It was strange to me to be standing there with thosetwo wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death.“Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other sideof the moat. It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared againcoming slowly in our direction.“‘Here they are!’ I exclaimed.“‘You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,’ whispered Abdullah. ‘Givehim no cause for fear. Send us in with him, and we shall do the restwhile you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, thatwe may be sure that it is indeed the man.’“The light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, untilI could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat. I letthem scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climbhalf-way up to the gate, before I challenged them.“‘Who goes there?’ said I, in a subdued voice.“‘Friends,’ came the answer. I uncovered my lantern and threw a floodof light upon them. The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beardwhich swept nearly down to his cummerbund. Outside of a show I havenever seen so tall a man. The other was a little, fat, round fellow,with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in ashawl. He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his handstwitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left andright with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when heventures out from his hole. It gave me the chills to think of killinghim, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flintwithin me. When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joyand came running up towards me.“‘Your protection, Sahib,’ he panted,—‘your protection for the unhappymerchant Achmet. I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seekthe shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed and beaten andabused because I have been the friend of the Company. It is a blessednight this when I am once more in safety,—I and my poor possessions.’“‘What have you in the bundle?’ I asked.“‘An iron box,’ he answered, ‘which contains one or two little familymatters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry tolose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, andyour governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.’“I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man. The more Ilooked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that weshould slay him in cold blood. It was best to get it over.“‘Take him to the main guard,’ said I. The two Sikhs closed in upon himon each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched inthrough the dark gateway. Never was a man so compassed round withdeath. I remained at the gateway with the lantern.“I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding throughthe lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and ascuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to myhorror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loudbreathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long, straightpassage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smearof blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like atiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand.I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He wasgaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and gotto the open air he would save himself yet. My heart softened to him,but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. I castmy firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice overlike a shot rabbit. Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was uponhim, and buried his knife twice in his side. The man never uttered moannor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen. I think myself that hemay have broken his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I amkeeping my promise. I am telling you every work of the business justexactly as it happened, whether it is in my favour or not.”He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-waterwhich Holmes had brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had nowconceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-bloodedbusiness in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhatflippant and careless way in which he narrated it. Whatever punishmentwas in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me.Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeplyinterested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon theirfaces. He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance inhis voice and manner as he proceeded.“It was all very bad, no doubt,” said he. “I should like to know howmany fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot whenthey knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains.Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If he hadgot out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have beencourt-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not verylenient at a time like that.”“Go on with your story,” said Holmes, shortly.“Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I. A fine weight he was,too, for all that he was so short. Mahomet Singh was left to guard thedoor. We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared. Itwas some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great emptyhall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. The earthfloor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we leftAchmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loosebricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure.“It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked. The box wasthe same which now lies open upon your table. A key was hung by asilken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and thelight of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I haveread of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. It wasblinding to look upon them. When we had feasted our eyes we took themall out and made a list of them. There were one hundred and forty-threediamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, Ibelieve, ‘the Great Mogul’ and is said to be the second largest stonein existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and onehundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. Therewere forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates,and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats’-eyes, turquoises, andother stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time,though I have become more familiar with them since. Besides this, therewere nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set ina gold coronet. By the way, these last had been taken out of the chestand were not there when I recovered it.“After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest andcarried them to the gateway to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then wesolemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to oursecret. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the countryshould be at peace again, and then to divide it equally amongourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of suchvalue were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was noprivacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carriedthe box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body,and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made ahollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of the place, andnext day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of thefour of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each alwaysact for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that Ican put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken.“Well, there’s no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indianmutiny. After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the backof the business was broken. Fresh troops came pouring in, and NanaSahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column underColonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away fromit. Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four werebeginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go offwith our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes wereshattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.“It came about in this way. When the rajah put his jewels into thehands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man.They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajahdo but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play thespy upon the first? This second man was ordered never to let Achmet outof his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He went after himthat night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thoughthe had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission therehimself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to himso strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who broughtit to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made,and the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thoughtthat all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on acharge of murder,—three of us because we had held the gate that night,and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of themurdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, forthe rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had anyparticular interest in them. The murder, however, was clearly made out,and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. Thethree Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death,though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others.“It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. Therewe were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance ofever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might haveput each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. It wasenough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick andthe cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and waterto drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, justwaiting to be picked up. It might have driven me mad; but I was alwaysa pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time.“At last it seemed to me to have come. I was changed from Agra toMadras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. There are veryfew white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well fromthe first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person. I was givena hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of MountHarriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary,fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infestedwith wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoneddart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging, and ditching, andyam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busyenough all day; though in the evening we had a little time toourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for thesurgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the time Iwas on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of milesfrom any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: soit was a terribly difficult job to get away.“The surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and theother young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and playcards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to hissitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I feltlonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then,standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fondof a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one towatch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, andLieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, andthere was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials,crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game. A very snug littleparty they used to make.“Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was thatthe soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, Idon’t say that there was anything unfair, but so it was. Theseprison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they hadbeen at the Andamans, and they knew each other’s game to a point, whilethe others just played to pass the time and threw their cards downanyhow. Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and thepoorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was thehardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon itcame to notes of hand and for big sums. He sometimes would win for afew deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set inagainst him worse than ever. All day he would wander about as black asthunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.“One night he lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in myhut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way totheir quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never farapart. The major was raving about his losses.“‘It’s all up, Morstan,’ he was saying, as they passed my hut. ‘I shallhave to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.’“‘Nonsense, old chap!’ said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder.‘I’ve had a nasty facer myself, but—’ That was all I could hear, but itwas enough to set me thinking.“A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so Itook the chance of speaking to him.“‘I wish to have your advice, major,’ said I.“‘Well, Small, what is it?’ he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips.“‘I wanted to ask you, sir,’ said I, ‘who is the proper person to whomhidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half a millionworth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the bestthing that I could do would be to hand it over to the properauthorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened forme.’“‘Half a million, Small?’ he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I wasin earnest.“‘Quite that, sir,—in jewels and pearls. It lies there ready for anyone. And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawedand cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.’“‘To government, Small,’ he stammered,—‘to government.’ But he said itin a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.“‘You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to theGovernor-General?’ said I, quietly.“‘Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent.Let me hear all about it, Small. Give me the facts.’“I told him the whole story, with small changes so that he could notidentify the places. When I had finished he stood stock still and fullof thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was astruggle going on within him.“‘This is a very important matter, Small,’ he said, at last. ‘You mustnot say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.’“Two nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut inthe dead of the night with a lantern.“‘I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your ownlips, Small,’ said he.“I repeated it as I had told it before.“‘It rings true, eh?’ said he. ‘It’s good enough to act upon?’“Captain Morstan nodded.“‘Look here, Small,’ said the major. ‘We have been talking it over, myfriend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secretof yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a privateconcern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing ofas you think best. Now, the question is, what price would you ask forit? We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, ifwe could agree as to terms.’ He tried to speak in a cool, careless way,but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed.“‘Why, as to that, gentlemen,’ I answered, trying also to be cool, butfeeling as excited as he did, ‘there is only one bargain which a man inmy position can make. I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and tohelp my three companions to theirs. We shall then take you intopartnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.’“‘Hum!’ said he. ‘A fifth share! That is not very tempting.’“‘It would come to fifty thousand apiece,’ said I.“‘But how can we gain your freedom? You know very well that you ask animpossibility.’“‘Nothing of the sort,’ I answered. ‘I have thought it all out to thelast detail. The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fitfor the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. Thereare plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which wouldserve our turn well. Do you bring one over. We shall engage to getaboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indiancoast you will have done your part of the bargain.’“‘If there were only one,’ he said.“‘None or all,’ I answered. ‘We have sworn it. The four of us mustalways act together.’“‘You see, Morstan,’ said he, ‘Small is a man of his word. He does notflinch from his friend. I think we may very well trust him.’“‘It’s a dirty business,’ the other answered. ‘Yet, as you say, themoney would save our commissions handsomely.’“‘Well, Small,’ said the major, ‘we must, I suppose, try and meet you.We must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me wherethe box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to Indiain the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair.’“‘Not so fast,’ said I, growing colder as he got hot. ‘I must have theconsent of my three comrades. I tell you that it is four or none withus.’“‘Nonsense!’ he broke in. ‘What have three black fellows to do with ouragreement?’“‘Black or blue,’ said I, ‘they are in with me, and we all gotogether.’“Well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh,Abdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present. We talked the matterover again, and at last we came to an arrangement. We were to provideboth the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark theplace in the wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was to go toIndia to test our story. If he found the box he was to leave it there,to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lieoff Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finallyto return to his duties. Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave ofabsence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final divisionof the treasure, he taking the major’s share as well as his own. Allthis we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think orthe lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by themorning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign offour,—that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself.“Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that myfriend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I’llmake it as short as I can. The villain Sholto went off to India, but henever came back again. Captain Morstan showed me his name among a listof passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards. Hisuncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet hecould stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstan went overto Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that thetreasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all, withoutcarrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret.From that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and Inursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion withme. I cared nothing for the law,—nothing for the gallows. To escape, totrack down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,—that was my onethought. Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in mymind than the slaying of Sholto.“Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never onewhich I did not carry out. But it was weary years before my time came.I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. One daywhen Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander waspicked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick to death, and hadgone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though he was asvenomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him allright and able to walk. He took a kind of fancy to me then, and wouldhardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. Ilearned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all thefonder of me.“Tonga—for that was his name—was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomycanoe of his own. When I found that he was devoted to me and would doanything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it over withhim. He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharfwhich was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up. I gave himdirections to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams,cocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes.“He was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a morefaithful mate. At the night named he had his boat at the wharf. As itchanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,—a vilePathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. Ihad always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fatehad placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left theisland. He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine onhis shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with,but none could I see. Then a queer thought came into my head and showedme where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darknessand unstrapped my wooden leg. With three long hops I was on him. He puthis carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked thewhole front of his skull in. You can see the split in the wood nowwhere I hit him. We both went down together, for I could not keep mybalance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough. I madefor the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had broughtall his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Amongother things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nutmatting, with which I made a sort of sail. For ten days we were beatingabout, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by atrader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malaypilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settledown among them. They had one very good quality: they let you alone andasked no questions.“Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum andI went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here untilthe sun was shining. Here and there we drifted about the world,something always turning up to keep us from London. All the time,however, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto atnight. A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. At last, however,some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England. I had nogreat difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work todiscover whether he had realised the treasure, or if he still had it. Imade friends with someone who could help me,—I name no names, for Idon’t want to get any one else in a hole,—and I soon found that hestill had the jewels. Then I tried to get at him in many ways; but hewas pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his sons andhis khitmutgar, on guard over him.“One day, however, I got word that he was dying. I hurried at once tothe garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and,looking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sonson each side of him. I’d have come through and taken my chance with thethree of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knewthat he was gone. I got into his room that same night, though, and Isearched his papers to see if there was any record of where he hadhidden our jewels. There was not a line, however: so I came away,bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me thatif I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to knowthat I had left some mark of our hatred; so I scrawled down the sign ofthe four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on hisbosom. It was too much that he should be taken to the grave withoutsome token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled.“We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairsand other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat anddance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day’swork. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for someyears there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for thetreasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. Thetreasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr.Bartholomew Sholto’s chemical laboratory. I came at once and had a lookat the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to makemy way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, andalso about Mr. Sholto’s supper-hour. It seemed to me that I couldmanage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me with along rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soonmade his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it,Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought hehad done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up bythe rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very muchsurprised was he when I made at him with the rope’s end and cursed himfor a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let itdown, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the fourupon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to thosewho had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed thewindow, and made off the way that he had come.“I don’t know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard awaterman speak of the speed of Smith’s launch the _Aurora_, so Ithought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with oldSmith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship. Heknew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in oursecrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, itis not to amuse you,—for you have not done me a very good turn,—but itis because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold backnothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been servedby Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.”“A very remarkable account,” said Sherlock Holmes. “A fitting wind-upto an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to me inthe latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your ownrope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lostall his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.”“He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipeat the time.”“Ah, of course,” said Holmes. “I had not thought of that.”“Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?” asked theconvict, affably.“I think not, thank you,” my companion answered.“Well, Holmes,” said Athelney Jones, “You are a man to be humoured, andwe all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, andI have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. Ishall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe underlock and key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspectorsdownstairs. I am much obliged to you both for your assistance. Ofcourse you will be wanted at the trial. Good-night to you.”“Good-night, gentlemen both,” said Jonathan Small.“You first, Small,” remarked the wary Jones as they left the room.“I’ll take particular care that you don’t club me with your wooden leg,whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles.”“Well, and there is the end of our little drama,” I remarked, after wehad set some time smoking in silence. “I fear that it may be the lastinvestigation in which I shall have the chance of studying yourmethods. Miss Morstan has done me the honour to accept me as a husbandin prospective.”He gave a most dismal groan. “I feared as much,” said he. “I reallycannot congratulate you.”I was a little hurt. “Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with mychoice?” I asked.“Not at all. I think she is one of the most charming young ladies Iever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have beendoing. She had a decided genius that way: witness the way in which shepreserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. Butlove is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed tothat true cold reason which I place above all things. I should nevermarry myself, lest I bias my judgment.”“I trust,” said I, laughing, “that my judgment may survive the ordeal.But you look weary.”“Yes, the reaction is already upon me. I shall be as limp as a rag fora week.”“Strange,” said I, “how terms of what in another man I should calllaziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigour.”“Yes,” he answered, “there are in me the makings of a very fine loaferand also of a pretty spry sort of fellow. I often think of those linesof old Goethe,—Schade dass die Natur nur _einen_ Mensch aus Dir schuf,Denn zum würdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff.“By the way, _à propos_ of this Norwood business, you see that theyhad, as I surmised, a confederate in the house, who could be none otherthan Lal Rao, the butler: so Jones actually has the undivided honour ofhaving caught one fish in his great haul.”“The division seems rather unfair,” I remarked. “You have done all thework in this business. I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit,pray what remains for you?”“For me,” said Sherlock Holmes, “there still remains thecocaine-bottle.” And he stretched his long white hand up for it.*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SIGN OF THE FOUR ***Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in theUnited States without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.
